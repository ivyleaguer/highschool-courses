<b>Playthings, puppets and the Puppet Master</b>

      Discussing the very nature  of Humanity, one must come
across  the  question  of   responsibility,  whether  it  is
Humanity  who is  responsible for  its deeds  or some higher
force. There  seems to be  a certain disagreement  about the
answer  to this  question, both  in Vonnegut's  work and  in
published  critical  work.  Doris  Lessing,  a distinguished
British writer, for example, thinks that

           Vonnegut  is moral  in an  old-fashioned way.  He
         does take the full  weight of responsibility, while
         more  and  more  people  are  shrugging  off the we
         should have and  we ought to have and  we can if we
         want and coming to see history as a puppet show and
         our -- humanity's -- slide into chaos as beyond our
         prevention, our  will, our choice.  The strength of
         Kurt  Vonnegut   Jr.,  this  deliberate   and  self
         conscious heir, derives from his refusal to succumb
         to  this new  and general  feeling of hopelessness.
         (Lessing:35)

This  argument can  be opposed,  for example,  by Ranly  who
notes  that all  Vonnegut's characters  are "comic, pathetic
pieces,  juggled  about  by  some  inexplicable  fate,  like
puppets" (Ranly:208).  Both Ranly and  Lessing use the  word
puppet,  yet they  completely  disagree  about the  issue of
responsibility in Vonnegut's work.
      At this point, Ranly's  argument will be examined more
closely. Humanity,  as presented by  Vonnegut, seems not  to
have  any free  will, it  seems to  be an  entity completely
ruled by some forces,  either forces originating from inside
of  the human  being, or  forces from  "above", or  both. In
neither case, however, Humanity has  a way to protect itself
from these forces or do anything at all about them. Humanity
is  led  by  these  forces  into  all  kinds  of situations.
Humanity  seems to  be a  puppet in  the han  d of  a puppet
master,  a plaything  designed  for  amusement or  for being
tested in how much it  can stand. Vonnegut says this himself
in his book <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>:

         there are  almost no characters in  this story, and
         almost no dramatic  confrontations, because most of
         the  people  in  it  are  so  sick  and so much the
         listless playthings of enormous forces. (SH5:164)

      Pawns, the lowest and least important of chess playing
stones, are  what Vonnegut's characters can  be compared to.
This  argument  is  employed  in  Reed's  book,  for example
(Reed:209), and Jarab, who  describes the main characters of
<i>Slapstick</i> and  <i>Mother Night</i> as "simple  and certainly useful
pawns, who,  however, can be  sacrificed anytime during  the
big  chess  game  of  history"  (Jarab:239,  transl.). Also,
Vonnegut himself uses the idea  of chess stones in his story
"All the King's Horses"  (WTM:84-103), where chess is played
with  real people,  some soldiers,  a woman  and two  little
children, instead  of stones. The people  are killed if they
are "taken" by  the enemy. In the story,  none of the people
is  responsible for  anything, any  moves, any  attacks, any
retreats etc.  The only responsible  characters are the  two
players who decide on the moves, even though the players are
people in this case, too.
      Another idea that compares people to playthings is the
quotation taken out of William Shakespeare's As You Like It:
"All the  world's a stage and  all the men and  women merely
players"  (TQK:38).  People  in  Vonnegut's  fiction  really
appear to be actors, who do  not act of their free will, but
that of the playwright.


<u><b>Human life and its value</b></u>

      Showing that people are playthings or puppets or pawns
or players also  leads to the right conception  of the value
of human  life in Vonnegut's writing.  Frequent occurence of
death  depicted  in  various  ways  is  constantly  present.
Generally speaking,  there are two most  remarkable views on
life and  death. One of the  views shows that human  life is
priceless,  very valuable,  item of  the highest importance.
The other  view contradicts the first  one, because it shows
that human life does not really  have any value, that it can
be and often is wasted for almost any reason.


<b>Life without price</b>

      Some works of Kurt Vonnegut  show that human life does
not  have a  very great  value or  high price.  This can  be
concluded  from several  hints. In  <i>Galapagos</i>, for  example,
Vonnegut puts a star to every name of a person, who is going
to  die in  the following  chapter. It  is a  rather amusing
feature at first, but later it makes the reader wonder about
the value  of life, about  the question whether  that is all
that can be said about the  loss of human life. "This person
is  going to  die" the  star seems  to say  -- only that and
nothing  more,  no  compassion,  no  feeling,  nothing.  The
greatest  effect of  using the  stars with  names of  people
close to  death is reached  by using the  star with Mandarax
(an  amazing computer  capable of  doing almost  everything,
from translating and interpreting  all languages and quoting
famous  people  and  famous   quotations  to,  for  example,
diagnosing  a  mental  illness,  or  arranging flowers). The
computer is  mentioned numerously throughout  the whole book
and close to the end a star wi th the name Mandarax preceeds
its drowning  in the sea.  By using the  same tool for  both
human death and the end of Mandarax, Vonnegut appears to say
that the value of human life equals the value of a computer,
of a machine. The reader may wonder whether this example may
show that when a person dies in the book, it should evoke no
more  feelings  for  the  dying  one  than  for  a  piece of
electronic equipment.
      Furthermore,  to   stay  with  the   novel  <i>Galapagos</i>,
Vonnegut  uses  one  phrase  everytime  somebody  dies:  "he
wasn't  going to  write Beethoven's  Ninth Symphony  anyway"
(e.g. GAL:244-245).  In this way, another  view is shown and
that is the opinion that the  human life is valuable as long
as the person does something important in people's eyes: for
example, write  a famous symphony. Otherwise,  there need to
be no  tears and no  emotions about a  dead person, who  was
just another human being, one out of many. Similar phrase as
the  one  about  Beethoven's   Ninth  Symphony  is  used  in
<i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>. It  is much shorter  but, on the  other
hand, it is used much more frequently. Everytime a character
dies, Vonnegut  says "So it  goes." The epitaph  appears one
hundred and six times altogether throughout the novel. It is
no  wonder death  occurs so  often in  the novel,  since the
prime topic  of the book  is the fire-bombing  of Dresden in
World War  Two. The phrase seems  to suggest that it  is not
a great tragedy when some body  dies, that it is normal, and
does not deserve more time speaking about it than necessary.
In <i>Deadeye Dick</i>, when somebody  dies, Vonnegut does not call
it  dying. He  writes that  this person  had their "peephole
closed"  and  when  they  are  born,  they simply have their
"peephole opened".  This, again, seems  to show, that  human
life  is no  more than  "peeping" through  a hole  and death
means only an end to this.
      In  <i>Deadeye  Dick</i>,  Vonnegut   calls  a  neutron  bomb
a "friendly bomb", because it destroys people and leaves all
the  property untouched.  (DED:34) DeMott  asks a  difficult
question: "Why do human beings take satisfaction in creating
a neutron bomb that destroys  'only' human beings, not their
accoutrements?" (DeMott, 1982:p.1) In this example property,
houses,  cars,  home  equipment  and  other  valuable things
appear to be worth much more than human lives.
      A rather  common theme in  Vonnegut is showing  people
who are reduced to mere numbers,  be it soldiers (such as in
<i>Sirens of Titan</i>), or workers  (e.g. Player Piano) or anybody
else.  People reduced  to numbers  do not  have much  value,
either. In the story  "The Lie" (WTM:222-236) Vonnegut shows
a young boy, Eli  Remenzel, who is supposed to  go to a very
prestigeous  school,  only  because  all  the  Remenzels  in
history went there. On the  way there, his mother counts all
his predecessors  and finds out that  Eli is actually number
thirty-one.  His feelings  do  not  matter, his  wishes, his
fears do not matter. The only  thing that matters is that he
is number thirty-one. The theme  can be found in other works
as well, for example <i>Sirens of Titan</i>, <i>Hocus Pocus</i>, or Player
Piano. In  "Harrison Bergeron" this theme  can be recognized
as well. Vonnegut shows the readers a society where everyone
is completely equal, equal even  in things as absurd as body
weight or intelligence or how one looks like. This, however,
redu ces the human being into a mere number, too. The person
loses  his individual  features,  ceases  to be  special any
more. The  people in "Harrison  Bergeron", through acquiring
equality, reach uniformity and deformity of self instead.
      To  go  further  from  showing  unimportance  of human
beings as individuals, it can be  said that the same view is
taken  for humankind  in  general,  for Humanity.  The novel
<i>Galapagos</i>  demonstrates this  very apparently.  There is  an
apocalypse and  only a few  people survive on  the <i>Galapagos</i>
Islands. However, evolution does  its work with this remnant
of  humanity  and  people  evolve  into  different  kind  of
species,  a  species  with  flippers  instead  of  hands and
a brain that  is much smaller and  much less capable. Again,
there is no  feeling or compassion for the  lost species. It
seems that the world is  better off without people, at least
people as we know them. It  seems that the phrase "He wasn't
going  to write  Beethoven's Ninth  Symphony anyway"  can be
applied  here, too,  meaning that  the same  way people  are
unimportant  and  there  is   nothing  special  about  them,
Humanity is  unimportant and there is  nothing special about
it, either.


<b>The only thing that matters: human life</b>

      The previous  section has shown  that humanity appears
to  be  disposable.  However,  this  cynicism  is not shared
everywhere  in  Vonnegut's  work.  On  the  contrary,  there
appears another view which shows  the value of human life in
a different light.
      In  <i>Timequake</i>, when  Kilgore Trout  observes dead  and
dying people, a completely different attitude to human death
is  seen.  While  the  epitaph  "he  was  not going to write
Beethoven's  Ninth  Symphony   anyway"  could  be  inscribed
emotionlessly upon  the grave of  humanity in other  novels,
Kilgore Trout does not share this:

         The  dead and  dying were  widely scattered, rather
         than heaped  or enclosed in  a burning or  crumpled
         airplane or bus. They were still individuals. Alive
         or dead, they still had personalities, with stories
         to read in their faces and clothes. (TQK:110)

This  humane view  of dead  people seems  to be  a rarity in
Vonnegut's books.
      In the apocalyptic novel  <i>Cat's Cradle</i>, there are many
other clues that  can lead to the discovery  that human life
is valuable. For Bokonists, there is one thing that matters,
one sacred thing.  It is "not even God,"  there is "just one
thing." The answer to what it  is, is neither the ocean, nor
the sun. It's "Man ...  That's all. Just man" (CAT:143). For
example,  when a  Bokonist is  about to  commit suicide,  he
always  says:   "Now  I  will   destroy  the  whole   world"
(CAT:160).  Todd calls  this kind  of mora  lism "vague,  so
undemanding, a dreamily humanist nihilism..." (Todd:107).
      Bryant finds more truth and maybe the foundation about
the human worth in Vonnegut's writing:

              "Human  worth  --  and  hence  significance --
         resides in  the being of the  human.The self is its
         own  reason  for  being:   its  being  is  its  own
         guarantee of its value." (Bryant:303)

Vonnegut, showing Humanity in the worst light possible, over
and over  again describes that human  lives are precious and
valuable in  themselves. People do  not need to  prove to be
worthy, their worth  is there no matter what  kind of person
they  happen to  be. Vonnegut  depicts ususally  broken down
people,  criminals, failures  etc., while  still showing the
fact that their value is great, beyond measurement.


<u><b>Bugs in Amber</b></u>

      The lack of  free will is a common  feature in most of
Vonnegut's   books.  In   <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>,  for  example
Vonnegut introduces  the phrase 'bugs in  amber'. One of the
examples is  the passage which  shows (from the  view of the
Tralfamadorians)  that  the  future  is  given  and that one
cannot change it.

              All moments, past, present, and future, always
         have    existed,    always    will    exist.    The
         Tralfamadorians  can  look  at  all  the  different
         moments just  the way we  can look at  a stretch of
         the Rocky Mountains, for instance. (SH5:27)

Another  passage  of  the  novel  describes  the  theme more
directly.  It is  the part  when the  Tralfamadorians kidnap
Billy Pilgrim and he asks "why?".

              "Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber?"
              "Well,  here we  are, Mr.  Pilgrim, trapped in
         the  amber  of  this  moment.  There  is  no  why."
         (SH5:76-77)

This  concept  views  the  world  as  a  kind  of  amber and
everything in the world as a  'bug' trapped in it, unable to
control  what  it  is  doing,  having  no  free will at all.
Humanity, according  to this, cannot help  what it is doing.
Thus Bokonon and  Jonah in <i>Cat's Cradle</i> can  sing a Bokonist
tune:

         We do, doodley do, doodley  do, doodley do, What we
         must,  muddily  must,  muddily  must, muddily must;
         Muddily  do, muddily  do, muddily  do, muddily  do,
         Until  we bust,  bodily bust,  bodily bust,  bodily
         bust. (CAT:178)

<i>Timequake</i>, Vonnegut's latest novel, deals with free will, or
the lack of  it, very directly, too. In  the story, there is
a timequake  that  causes  the  time  to  go back ten years.
Everything  the people  went through  during the  ten years,
they  have  to  go  through  again,  without  any  chance of
changing things. Vonnegut calls  it a 'rerun' (e.g. TQK:123)
or an  'automatic pilot' (e.g.  TQK:192). Just like  a pilot
who  has  no  control  over  a  plane  that  is  flown on an
automatic pilot,  the characters and whole  Humanit y has no
way of controling what is going to happen next.
      The structure of Vonnegut's  novels itself reveals the
fact that everything  is set and the characters  have no way
of changing  the storyline. The plot  is usually revealed in
the first couple of chapters (e.g. GAL, SH5, HOC, BOC etc.),
the reader almost always knows what is going to happen next.
The narrator  often occupies a  vantage point for  observing
the whole story. In <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, for instance, it is
the view of Tralfamadorians who see in the fourth dimension,
therefore  see everything  that has  happened and  that will
happen.  In  <i>Galapagos</i>  it  is  the  viewpoint  of  a  ghost
narrating  the  story  a  million  years  after  it actually
happened, therefore  seeing it from a  very similar point to
the Tralfamadorians?.
      If  there   is  a  puppet  which   is  actually  doing
something,  there  also  must  be  a  puppet  master.  It is
difficult  to  recognize  the  puppet  master,  though.  The
'enormous  force'  (SH5:164),  the  source  of  all  acts of
Humanity differs from  book to book. In <i>Galapagos</i>  it is the
people's  big brains.  In some  other books  (e.g. HOC, BOC,
DED), it is chemicals or  fault in the 'construction' of the
human being:

              It is  a big temptation  to me, when  I create
         a character for a novel, to  say that he is what he
         is  because   of  faulty  wiring,   or  because  of
         microscopic  amounts of  chemicals which  he ate or
         failed to eat on that particular day. (BOC:4)

Some of  the most gruesome  accidents, says Vonnegut,  "were
caused by  people who had rendered  themselves imbecillic or
maniacal because by ingesting too  much of what, if taken in
moderation,  could be  a helpful  chemical" (HOC:28). Wilbur
Swain's mother, in <i>Slapstick</i>, is described as "a symphony of
chemical reactions"  (SLP:58). In some novels  the source is
the sexual  drive or other  physical needs. The  key word is
probably the word 'physical'.  Vonnegut often sees the fault
in the body.  In <i>Bluebeard</i>, for example, that  fault is seen
in the 'meat':  "I would hate to be  responsible for what my
meat  does." When  people do  something terrible,  it is the
'meat's' fault (BLU:246).
      On the other hand,  in <i>Breakfast of Champions</i> Vonnegut
muses  about  the  idea  of  God  being  the  cause. He uses
a parallel:  the  'destructive   testing  division'  at  the
Pontiac Division of General Motors, where

         various  parts  of   automobiles  and  even  entire
         automobiles were destroyed.  Pontiac scientists set
         upholstery  on fire,  threw gravel  at windshields,
         snapped   crankshafts   and   driveshafts,   staged
         head-on  collisions, tore  gearshift levers  out by
         the roots,  ran engines at high  speeds with almost
         no lubrication, opened and closed glove compartment
         doors  a hundred  times a  minute for  days, cooled
         dashboard  clocks  to  within   a  few  degrees  of
         absolute zero, and so on.
              Everything you're not supposed to do to a car,
         they did to a car. (BOC:165-166)

Vonnegut wonders if  this is the reason what  God put people
on earth for,  whether it was to test them  and find out how
much  they can  stand without  breaking (BOC:166).  From the
novel it seems  that he thinks that this  is, obviously, the
reason.
      In  <i>Galapagos</i>,  he  says  that  people  are  "nature's
experiments"  (GAL:82),  which  corresponds  with  the above
view, only  with one difference that  Vonnegut uses the word
"nature" instead of "God". However,  it can be assumed, that
he has  one entity in mind,  since both, nature and  God can
take  up the  role of,  or be  seen as,  the Creator  of the
Universe, of the world, of the human beings.
      After all, Vonnegut seems to imply, God is the creator
of the 'meat'  and the designer of the  'big brain', both of
which a  human being cannot  control, both of  which a human
being is  subject to. Another  clue of God  being the source
can be  seen: If God created  the whole reality, then  it is
the maker of the amber  as well. What are people predestined
to do must have been predestined by God, the creator.
      Whatever  or whoever  the puppet  master might  be, it
will hence be called Divinity, as a counterpart to Humanity.
