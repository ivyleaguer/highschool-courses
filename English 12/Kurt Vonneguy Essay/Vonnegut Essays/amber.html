<b>Bugs in Amber</b>
Definition of  the major theme of  Tom Stoppard's <u>Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are Dead</u> - "we are bugs trapped in amber"
Marek Vit

     That  we, people,  are "bugs  in amber"  is one  of the main
themes   of   Kurt   Vonnegut's   novel  <u>Slaughterhouse-Five;  or
Children's   Crusade</u>.   Tom   Stoppard's   play  <u>Rosencrantz  and
Guildenstern  are Dead</u>  is, in  my opinion,  very similar to this
book. While <u>Slaugterhouse-Five</u> is an American novel, a mixture of
the  author's Second  World War  experiences and  science fiction
genre, <u>Rosencrantz  and Guildenstern are  Dead</u> is a  British play
set  into  William  Shakespeare's  <u>Hamlet</u>.  What  are  these  two
literary works  similar in, then?  It is the  central theme. Both
works show that we are physically stuck in this world, our future
is already  given, and we  have no way  of escaping our  destiny.
Both  writers  provide  a   little  room  for  their  character's
imagination  which  is,  in  my  opinion,  crucial  item  of both
literary works.
     In this  paper I will  try to use  Kurt Vonnegut's novel  to
help me point out the major theme of <u>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
are Dead</u> and to explain and  clarify the theme's meaning and main
message.
     The main  theme of <u>Slaughterhouse-Five</u>  is expressed several
times throughout  the novel. One  of the examples  is the passage
which  shows  (from  the  view  of  the  Tralfamadorians -- alien
beings) that the future is given and that one cannot change it.

     "All  moments,  past,  present,   and  future,  always  have
existed, always  will exist. The Tralfamadorians  can look at all
the different  moments just the way  we can look at  a stretch of
the Rocky Mountains, for instance." (Vonnegut:27)


Another passage  of the novel describes  the theme more directly.
It is the part when  the Tralfamadorians kidnap Billy Pilgrim and
he asks "why?".

     "Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber?
     Well, here we are, Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this
moment. There is no <i>why</i>." (ibid 76-77)

These  two passages  illustrate  the  novel's theme  quite fully.
We are physically stuck in this world and we can do nothing about
it.
     As  the "amber"  in  <u>Rosencrantz  and Guildenstern</u>  are Dead
serves William Shakespeare's play <u>Hamlet</u>. Both the author and the
characters  are stuck  in it.  There  is  no way  out, there  can
possibly  be no  way for  Rosencrantz and  Guildenstern to  avoid
their death  at the end.  Just like Billy  in <u>Slaughterhouse-Five</u>
they have foreknowledge  of their death, yet they  can do nothing
about it at  all. They all have to  continue as directed, because
they are stuck in amber.
     All characters, Billy  Pilgrim, Guildenstern and Rosencrantz
now may seem like puppets. They seem like they have no free will,
they  are  "led"  from  above.  Vonnegut's  characters  have been
describes  as  "comic,  pathetic  pieces,  juggled  about by some
inexplicable  faith,   like  puppets,"  (Ranly:494).   This  also
corresponds  with  Ranly's  idea  that  there  are no villains or
heroes  in Vonnegut's  books. I   think that  this could  also be
applied  to <u>Rosencrantz  and Guildenstern</u>.  "They answer  summons
from some source  they do not recognize, carry  out the task they
do  not understand  to end  in the  darkness they  do not want to
think about," (Weales:237-8). No character from the two books can
be blamed for  anything, bad or good, that  happens. They are led
from  above.  The  only  one  who  can  be  blamed is the "Master
Puppeteer"  who   controls  his  little   pieces.  In  <u>Slaughter-
house-Five</u> it can only be God. He  is the one, after all, who put
us into the amber, the one who "led" the people into such an evil
as World War Two. He can be the only villain in the novel.
     Similarly, the only villain  in <u>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
are  Dead</u> can  only be   William Shakespeare,  the author  of the
"amber".  Shakespeare may  be seen  in  the  same way  as God  in
<u>Slaughterhouse-Five</u> --  as the one  who created the  tragedies of
human lives.  Both these "supreme"  beings provided the  "amber",
both forgot  about their creations  and consider them  to be mere
tools for moving  the "great story" onward. Each  of the literary
works is, in Charles Marowitz's words, "a blinding metaphor about
the absurdity  of life. We  are summoned, we  come. We are  given
roles, we play them. We are  dismissed, we go. Have we ever been?
Has there been a point? If  so, what?" (Marowitz:327). Stoppard's
characters,  when  considering  the  point,  advise not  to apply
logic, or justice (Stoppard:81)
     The characters in both works,  however, are not seen as mere
puppets.  Both authors  made them  human by  allowing a space for
their imagination.  They can't do  anything about their  destiny,
but they can think about it. Billy Pilgrim shows himself as human
being  by  asking  the  Tralfamadorians  "why?" (Vonnegut:76-77).
Stoppard has also made his characters human by giving them "space
and  leisure  to   broach  abstruse  philosophical  questions..."
(Hayman:36):

     "Free to move, speak, extemporize, and yet. We have not been
cut  loose. Our  truancy is  defined by  one fixed  star, and our
drift represents  merely a slight change  of angle to it:  we may
seize the moment,  toss it around while the  moment pass, a short
dash here,  an exploration there,  but we are  brought round full
circle  to  face  again   the  single  immutable  fact--that  we,
Rosencrantz and  Guildenstern, bearing a letter  from one king to
another, are taking Hamlet to England." (Stoppard:74)

In  my opinion,  the authors  wanted to  show that  this is where
humans differ from machines and puppets. If we merely carried out
orders, we would not be human, we would not be humane.
