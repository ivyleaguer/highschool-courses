<b><u>Introduction</u></b>

    Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., was born on the eleventh day of November,
1922,  in Indianapolis,  Indiana. His  birth date,  which fell on
Armistice Day, would prove to be  an omen for his pacifist views.
He was the  grandson of the first licensed  architect in Indiana,
and  the  son  of  a  wealthy  architect.  The  Great Depression,
however, left  Vonnegut's father out  of work, and  the wealth of
the family soon diminished.
    It  was  at  Shortridge  High  School  in  Indianapolis  that
Vonnegut gained his first writing experience. During his last two
years  there he  wrote for  and  was  one of  the editors  of the
Shortridge  Daily Echo,  which was  the first  high school  daily
newspaper in the  country. At this young age  Vonnegut learned to
write for a wide audience that would give him immediate feedback,
rather than  just writing for an  audience of one in  the form of
a teacher.
    After graduating from Shortridge in 1940, Vonnegut headed for
Cornell University. His father wanted him to study something that
was  solid and  dependable, like  science, so  Vonnegut began his
college career as a chemistry and biology major, following in the
footsteps of his older brother, Bernard, who was to eventually be
the discoverer  of cloud seeding  to induce precipitation.  While
Vonnegut  struggled  in  his  chemistry  and  biology studies, he
excelled as a columnist and managing editor for the Cornell Daily
Sun.  But by  1943 Vonnegut  was on  the verge  of being asked to
leave Cornell due to his lackluster academic performance. He beat
Cornell to the punch by enlisting in the army.
    By this point Vonnegut's parents  had given up on life, being
unable to adjust  to or accept the fact that  they were no longer
wealthy, world travellers. On May  14, 1944, his mother committed
suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills. His father was to remain
a fairly isolated man the rest of  his days, in full retreat from
life, content  to be in his  own little world until  his death on
October 1, 1957 (Jailbird 12-13; hereinafter identified as "J").
    On December  14, 1944, Vonnegut  became a German  prisoner of
war after being captured in the  Battle of the Bulge. He was sent
to Dresden, an open city that  produced no war machinery; thus it
was off-limits to allied bombing. He and his fellow POW's were to
work in  a vitamin-syrup factory. On  February 13, 1945, however,
allied  forces  strafed   Dresden,  killing  135,000  unprotected
civilians. Vonnegut  and the other POW's  survived the bombing as
they waited it out deep in  the cellar of a slaughterhouse, where
they were quartered.
    Vonnegut was  repatriated on May  22, 1945, and  on September
first  of that  year he  married Jane  Marie Cox,  a friend since
kindergarten, for he  thought, "'Who but a wife  would sleep with
me?'" (J 10).
    Vonnegut spent  the next two years  in Chicago, attending the
University  of Chicago  as a  graduate anthropology  student, and
working for  the Chicago City  News Bureau as  a police reporter.
When his  master's thesis was rejected,  he moved to Schenectedy,
New York,  to work as  a publicist for  General Electric. It  was
here  that  his  fiction  career  began.  On  February  11, 1950,
Collier's published Vonnegut's first  short story, "Report on the
Barnhouse Effect."  By the next  year he was  making enough money
writing  to  quit  his  job  at  GE  and  move his family to West
Barnstable, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod.
    In 1952 his first novel,  Player Piano, was published. By the
time his next novel, The Sirens  of Titan, was published in 1959,
he  had  had  dozens  of  short  stories  published, worked as an
English teacher  at a school for  emotionally disturbed students,
run a Saab  dealership, seen his father die,  witnessed the death
of his 41-year  old sister, Alice, due to  cancer, which occurred
less than forty-eight hours after her husband had died in a train
accident, and had  adopted three of Alice's four  children to add
to his own stable of three kids.
    The sixties were highlighted by  the publication of four more
novels, a  collection of short stories,  and a two-year residency
at the  famous University of  Iowa Writers' Workshop.  The decade
culminated with  the publication of  Vonnegut's sixth, and  still
best, novel, Slaughterhouse-Five, in 1968.
    The early  seventies were an interesting  and hectic time for
Vonnegut.  Much  in  demand  as  the  voice  of  the college-aged
generation, he  spent time teaching creative  writing at Harvard,
wrote a  mildly successful off-Broadway  play, got divorced,  and
saw his  son Mark suffer  a schizophrenic breakdown.  By the time
Breakfast of Champions was published in 1973, Vonnegut's life was
starting to slow down just a  bit as he dropped from his pinnacle
in  the national  spotlight. The  critically lambasted  Slapstick
appeared in 1976, which was followed by 1979's Jailbird, the last
book of the quartet that this work will deal with.
