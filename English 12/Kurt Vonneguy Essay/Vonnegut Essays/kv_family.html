<b>Artificial Family Units in America:</b>
Vonnegut’s Philosophy on Interdependence and Relationships

by Lauren Abbott


      While on  the surface Kurt Vonnegut’s  works appear to
singularly contain the pessimistic  views of an aging, black
humorist,  his  underlying  meanings   reveal  a  much  more
sympathetic  and  hopeful  glimpse  of  humanity  that lends
itself  to   eventual  societal  improvement.   As  part  of
Vonnegut’s  strategy  for  enhanced  communal  welfare,  the
satirist  details  in  the  course  of  his  works potential
artificial family groups to connect the masses and alleviate
the   lonely.   Through   his   science   fiction  tales  of
misinterpreted,   downcast   protagonists   and   outrageous
observations  of  real  life,  Vonnegut  shines  a  light on
America’s  problems, proposing  a widespread  cooperation of
common  decency  and  interdependence  as  viable solutions.
Whether or not such notions  actually augment the quality of
relations,  Vonnegut’s  well-reasoned   and  starkly  ironic
scenarios entertain,  challenge, and enliven  his design for
relational  welfare through  synthetic families.  Throughout
his works Vonnegut’s development of artificial famili es and
expression  of  common   decency  between  characters  helps
illuminate his  universal theme of  societal interdependence
in family groups  and proves that life is  only worth living
when individuals support each other.
      Throughout  his writings,  Vonnegut illustrates  man’s
necessity  of family,  whether hereditary  or artificial, as
a vital contribution to his survival and healthy intercourse
with society.  All relatives, be they  naturally procured or
synthetically  acquired,  possess  the  unique  ability, and
responsibility, to  support, contribute to,  and inspire his
fellow  man,  which  in   turn  ultimately  appeals  to  the
betterment  of  humankind.  As  the  author  illustrates  in
<u>Timequake</u>,   as   diverse   as   individuals   may   be,  so
proportionately diverse  must families be also;  a family is
not and family values do not  entirely consist of a man, his
wife,  and   their  kids  fighting   against  “economic  and
technological and  ecological and political  chaos” (202) in
a Midwest  suburban community.  Family  is  where it  can be
found. And  in spite of any  character differences, “it [is]
natural, and therefore almost inevitable” (<u>Slapstick</u> 57) for
individuals  to  congregate  in  extended  families. In many
cases these  families form spontaneously as  a result of the
freemasonry shared  between persons of  similar interest, as
in the companionship one  doctor finds with another. Because
common  threads,   such  as  profession,   tie  compellingly
dissimilar persons  together, it is  possible “to belong  to
artificial   extended   families”   (5)   claiming   members
worldwide.   In   revealing   this   particular   aspect  of
companionship, George  Kraft and Howard W.  Campbell, Jr. in
<u>Mother Night</u>  kindle a friendship encouraged  by the absence
of both  their wives. Empathetic  relations between the  two
prove  “that  human  beings  in  extraordinary  and enduring
situations   should  think   themselves  as   composing  new
families” (  <u>Mother Night</u> 57). As  exemplified in most other
Vonnegut  books, The  Iron Guard  of the  White Sons  of the
American Constitution  was a naturally  forming family group
in  <u>Mother   Night</u>  that  catered   to  the  needs   of  its
participants,  filling   the  voids  in   their  lives  from
dysfunctional   selves,  relatives,   and  friends.  Brought
together by common ideals and  interests, as are most groups
of the type, the members  supported and helped each other in
improving  the  individual,  as  well  as  the  committee as
a whole. Vonnegut cites loneliness as the main cause for the
necessitation   of   formation   of   artificial   families.
Loneliness,  spurned  by  the  dissolution  of individuality
- the reality of becoming  an “interchangeable [part] in the
American machine”  (<u>Slapstick</u> 5) -  can only be  resolved in
companionship  with  others.  The  impersonality  of present
America  stems from  the idea  that life  is no good because
everyone  is either  stupid  or  unloving. Stupidity  may be
making life harder  on each person, but the  true fallacy of
modern  society is  lovelessness. Vonnegut  writes as though
America  would be  more sincere  if a  more definite  family
atmosphere were  implemented that catered  to and made  each
citizen an  absolute necessity to the  machine. Desperate to
find  their   respective  places,  many   citizens  such  as
Vonnegut’s own  Uncle Alex, search  for some group  that can
disperse  the isolation  from their  lives. Despite  a sober
lifestyle,  Uncle  Alex  Vonnegut  was  active in Alcoholics
Anonymous  merely  to  retain  the  relationships (<u>Slapstick</u>
10). While loneliness is often the root of artificial family
growth,  Vonnegut submits  that  often  the absence  or poor
quality of  one’s own biological family  creates a void that
is  only   to  be  filled  by   a  comparable  kinship.  “In
a hell-hole  like America  where everybody  takes such lousy
care    of   their    own   relatives”    (<u>Slapstick</u>   132),
dissatisfaction  in  natural  family  relations  is rampant.
Without  close hereditary  families to  depend on, abandoned
relatives  are  forced  to  look  elsewhere  for comfort and
charity -  to reliable relatives  of a different  sort. Such
artificial  extended families  are absolutely  imperative in
providing “an ideal diet  for human spirit” (<u>Timequake</u> 202).
Besides   offering   support,   family   systems  constitute
a society  of  structure  that  allows  liberty  to exist in
harmony with  conformity (Kelly). Much  like a square  dance
“people dance the same steps,  not because they have to, but
because when people  move together … it is  more pleasing to
the individual”  (Kelly) than if  he danced alone  or out of
time  with  others.  Square  dancers  conform  for their own
satisfaction. For  a family utopia to  exist, family members
must  observe  a  similar  concept  of  conformity to ensure
pleasure and fulfillment for  all. By practicing basic rules
of common decency this is achieved in beautiful proportions.
Only  as a  member of  expansive fami  ly groupings  can man
truly  find his  place in  society and  flourish amongst its
support  and companionship.  Whereas individuality  is often
exalted in contemporary literature, Vonnegut proves, through
philosophic  anecdotes and  personal examples,  that life is
made  easier  and  more  enjoyable  when  artificial  family
members are relied upon to provide sustenance and counsel.
      Drawing    from   familiar    individuals   and   past
experiences,  Vonnegut  relies  on  his  own  impression  of
families, natural  and otherwise, to create  plot and relate
his views to the reader audience. Using characters that very
nearly  mirror  himself,  his  life,  and  the  lives of his
family,   the  author   illustrates  his   theories  through
incidents  that  parallel  himself   and  help  develop  the
nearness   of   his    theme.   In   <u>Slapstick</u>,   Vonnegut’s
autobiographical introduction  and basis for  characters tie
the author’s message to himself and his own family. Even his
closing  words, “Das  ende” are  a throw  back to his German
roots  and family  heritage (Reed).  This method  of further
biographical  identity  makes  Vonnegut’s  artificial family
theme  receive authentic  application and  exercise in life.
Hailed as Vonnegut’s fictional  alter ego, Kilgore Trout, an
elderly,  fatalistic  science  fiction  writer,  appears  in
several novels, exhibiting  many typical Vonnegut tendencies
and  characteristics.  Trout’s  lack  of  family,  much like
Vonnegut’s current situation, relegates  him to a search for
alternative companionship, found in  his pet parakeet, Bill.
Through Trout does Vonnegut market superfluous short stories
and  vintage  experiences  to  illuminate  and  solidify his
message of  the importance of  family groups. Vonnegut  also
uses  versions  of  himself  in  other  writings  to further
impress his  theme by biographical  means, as in  <u>Slapstick</u>,
“the  closest [he]  ever came  to writing  an autobiography”
(1).  <u>Slapstick</u> revolves  around a  brother-sister duo, much
alike Vonnegut  and his late sister,  Alice, and reveals the
interdependence  between  the   two,  creating  a  practical
application  of  family  importance  in  his  own  life.  By
including various  elements from his  past, Vonnegut hammers
out  his  views  on  the  necessity  of artificial families,
cementing the high esteem he  holds his biological family in
and the  support he has  discovered from others  in place of
their   absences.  In   Slaughterhouse-Five  and  <u>Bluebeard</u>,
Vonnegut  uses  World  War   II  experiences  as  basis  for
storyline and theme. Using specific cites and incidents from
his war encounters, as in the previous two novels, he models
metaphoric  themes  after  his  views  on  family  as he has
observed himself.  In <u>Bluebeard</u>, the  narrator discusses the
camaraderie shared between artists in his army regiment much
the same  as Vonnegut felt  about his contemporaries  during
the  war.  Drawing  from  past  events  and information, the
author gathers together all previous and current impressions
of  family to  present  a  well-rounded mélange  of personal
values  and  family  ties  that  indicate  the importance of
supportive relatives.
      Whereas love  is often equated  with successful family
life  and  relationships,  Vonnegut  emphasizes  that common
decency, rather than love, is  the most effective and useful
agent in  perfecting relations with  others. “A little  less
love,  and  a  little  more  common  decency” (<u>Slapstick</u> 3),
according  to  Vonnegut,  is  all  that  is needed to ensure
a near  utopian climate  when  practiced  by all  members of
a society. As proved by Eliza and Wilbur Swain in <u>Slapstick</u>,
one  can survive,  and even  thrive, in  life without  being
showered with  love from others.  To the contrary,  the main
characters   actually  detest   and  find   impractical  the
implications   and   connotations   love   brings   to   any
relationship. When  common decency is  given higher priority
than love in family  relationships, the quality and quotient
for  success  is  greatly  increased,  bettering  the entire
situation.  Where common  decency  is  practiced, a  bond is
automatically  formed between  parties that  creates a unity
resembling family. As most  individuals, struggling in their
loneliness, are searching for  such compassions from others,
shared   common  decency   offers  the   much-needed  family
environment  situation imperative  in a  profitable society.
Truly  family-oriented sentiments  are the  only things that
connect diverse groups of people and make living worthwhile,
as Vonnegut  identifies in <u>Timequake</u>. To  him, “what [makes]
being alive  almost worthwhile …are  “the saints” he  meets,
“people   behaving  unselfishly   and  capably”   (<u>Timequake</u>
239-40). As decency  is the only thing that  makes the world
better, perhaps  family is the only  thing worth living for.
In  <u>Mother  Night</u>,  Vonnegut  emphasizes  this importance of
relying  on  others  as  Resi  asks,  “What  is life without
friends?” (151). Perhaps a side effect of man’s evolution as
an individual and as a  society is his increasing dependence
on others. Most characters experience a struggle against the
universe which  leaves them weak,  vulnerable, and dependent
on  others. Vonnegut  constantly petitions  society with the
pervading message  that “you’ve got  to be kind”  (God Bless
You, Mr. Rosewater). Vonnegut  illustrates, as in <u>Slapstick</u>,
that  this  dependence  is  only  successfully  achieved  in
practicing common decency. Therefore, fruitful relationships
as exhibited  in artificial family  groups, through treating
members  with  respect  and  sincerity,  creates  a  utopian
atmosphere for individuals. Thus  does Vonnegut create a web
of   interdependence  and   reliance  on   others  for   his
characters;  even  in  the  midst  of  sufferi  ng  and vile
discomfort,  to  truly  be  satisfied  one  must rely on the
positive influences of others.
      Vonnegut’s   clear   presentation   of   his  theories
pertaining  to artificial  family life  and incorporation of
personal family  experiences projects a  value of importance
and dependence  upon others in  his novels. He  stresses the
necessity  of quality  relations with  others, regardless of
where or how they are  formed, in leading a fulfilling life.
Vonnegut’s  own  philosophies  and  trials  with  relational
dependence provide a concise optimism that nearly erases all
skepticism and  defines the integral  components of fruitful
relationships.  While  Vonnegut’s  solutions  and methods to
obtaining  a  state  of  societal  utopia  and  abolition of
loneliness, a noble, large-scale task, appear idealistic and
slightly  stray from  typical Vonnegution  cynicism, a  more
serious   caution   pervades   his   texts,   seasoned  from
experience, and pleads that all members of society help each
other.  Such naked  requests cement  Vonnegut’s purpose  and
offer  a multi-faceted  thread  of  hope to  all individuals
hopelessly   lonely.   Vonnegut’s   incorporation   of   his
characters’  and own  personal search  for positive communal
relations illuminates his  concern for group interdependence
and belief that only through common decency can life be made
worth living.
