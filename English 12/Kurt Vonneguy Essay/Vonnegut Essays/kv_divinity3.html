<b><u>Divinity</u></b>
    The other literary character this essay is going to deal with
is Divinity: that  is, God, or gods. This  character plays a part
in almost  all novels by Kurt  Vonnegut and is seen  from similar
viewpoints.  Probably because  Vonnegut comes  from society where
Christianity is the major religion,  his ex-wife and daughter are
Christians (PS: 235), he mostly  refers to the 'Christian' God in
his  books.  However,  there  are  some  exceptions when Vonnegut
replaces  God  with  some  other  'higher'  force (such as Mother
Nature  in <i>Gal pagos</i>,  or Time  in <i>Jailbird</i>).  These substitutes,
however,  carry  the  same   attributes,  mostly  have  the  same
qualities as Vonnegut's God.
    Divinity  as a  character cannot  be studied  separately. Its
character  traits can  be defined  by examining  its relationship
with Humanity. Literary theory concerning physical appearance and
environment  is  not  applicable   here,  since  Vonnegut  hardly
mentions  these aspects  at all.  His image  of God  is, however,
quite well  described by indirect  indication. There are  various
hints throughout Vonnegut's books as  to what is God really like,
some mentioned by other literary characters, some stated directly
by the narrator of the story or Vonnegut himself.

<b>Lack of Concern</b>
    There is only one quality which could be isolated and studied
independently  on the  relationship  with  Humanity: the  lack of
concern  for anything,  indifference and  laziness (something  so
much  differing from  the Christian  view of  God, who  loves and
cares  for His  people, giving  Himself as  a sacrifice for their
sins etc.). Vonnegut's Divinity appears not to care about what it
created. This  aspect of Divinity gets  even more emphasized when
the relationship  with Humanity is brought  in the consideration.
Earlier, in 1959, Vonnegut had developed the idea of indifference
more in detail  in his novel <i>Sirens of  Titan</i>, which dealt, above
all, with Humanity. In the book, Vonnegut presents a new religion
invented by himself: 'The Church  of God Utterly Indifferent'. In
this a bit extreme concept he  illustrates that God does not care
about anything  at all and does  not intervene in the  affairs of
people at all. Throughout the whole novel an outcry can be heard:
"Take  Care of  the People,  and God  Almighty Will  Take Care of
Himself" (TIT:128)
    Together  with  indifference,   Vonnegut  sometimes  mentions
laziness of Divinity. A very good example of this can be found in
the  novel <i>Jailbird</i>,  where the  main character  speaks about his
wife, Ruth, who  had suffered in a concentration  camp during the
World War II.  "I asked her once whether she  had ever sought the
consolations  of religion  in the  concentration camp.  'No,' she
said. 'I knew God would never  come near such a place.'" (JAI:29)
Later,  Ruth gave  a toast  one Christmas  Eve with  these words:
"Here's to God Almighty, the laziest man in town" (JAI:30).
    Sometimes, it  is not only that  Vonnegut's Divinity does not
do anything which  shows its indifference. Mostly it  is the fact
it it does do something. A  good example would be Kilgore Trout's
dialogue with a truck driver in <i>Breakfast of Champions</i>, comparing
Divinity's and Humanity's indifference  toward the planet, nature
and life. Trout describes that  he "used to be a conservationist"
and  that  he  used  to  cry  about  people causing environmental
catastrophes, but that he has to laugh about it now.

              "I  realized,"  said  Trout,  "that  God wasn't any
         conservationist,  so  for  anybody  else  to  be one was
         sacrilegious and  a waste of  time. You ever  see one of
         His volcanoes or tornadoes  or tidal waves? Anybody ever
         tell  you  about  the  Ice  Ages  he  arranges for every
         half-million  years?   How  about  Dutch   Elm  disease?
         There's a nice conservation measure for you. That's God,
         not man. Just  about the time we got  our rivers cleaned
         up,  he'd  probably  have  the  whole  galaxy go up like
         a celluloid  collar. That's  what the  Star of Bethlehem
         was, you know." (BOC:84-85)

This  passage quite  well  illustrates  how divinity  employs its
destructive  powers.  <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>  describes  this in the
connection with  Humanity. In this  novel, Vonnegut mentions  the
destruction of Sodom  and Gomorrah. He sees this  Biblical act of
God  as an  evidence of  Divinity's lack  of concern for Humanity
(SH5:21-22).  He  seems  to  be  saying  that Divinity showed its
indifference toward people by  destroying them completely instead
of  saving  them,  not  caring  about  the  suffering of poor and
innocent people that, as Vonnegut supposes, lived there.
    Divinity is seen here as  an oppressor saying: 'You'll either
do what  I command you, or  you'll die.' This oppressor  does not
have in  mind the people at  all, it only pursues  to satisfy its
own ego.  It is seen  as an evil  and cruel ruler  with a rod  of
iron,  crushing  everything  that  does  not  please  its  fancy,
everything that disobeys its law.

<b>Playthings, puppets and the Puppet Master</b>
    Not only that Vonnegut sees Divinity as an oppressor, he sees
it also as the controller of Humanity. Humanity seems not to have
any  free will,  it seems  to be  an entity  completely ruled  by
Divinity, led into every situation by it, led to do everything by
it. Humanity seems to be a puppet in the hand of a puppet master,
to be a plaything designed for amusement or for being tested what
it can stand.
    Ranly  notes  that  all  Vonnegut's  characters  are  "comic,
pathetic pieces,  juggled about by  some inexplicable fate,  like
puppets."    (Ranly)    Vonnegut    says    this    himself    in
<i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>:  "there  are  almost  no  characters in this
story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because most of the
people in it  are so sick and so much  the listless playthings of
enormous forces." (SH5:164)
    The  lack  of  free  will  is  a  common  feature  in most of
Vonnegut's  books. In  <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, for  example Vonnegut
introduces the phrase 'bugs in amber'. One of the examples is the
passage  which shows  (from the  view of  the Tralfamadorians  --
alien beings) that the future is given and that one cannot change
it.

              All moments, past, present, and future, always have
         existed, always will exist. The Tralfamadorians can look
         at all the different moments just the way we can look at
         a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. (SH5:27)

Another passage  of the novel describes  the theme more directly.
It is the part when  the Tralfamadorians kidnap Billy Pilgrim and
he asks "why?".

              Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber?
              Well,  here we  are,  Mr.  Pilgrim, trapped  in the
         amber of this moment. There is no why." (SH5:76-77)

This concept views the world as a kind of amber and everything in
the world  as a 'bug' stuck  in it, unable to  control what it is
doing, having no  free will at all. Humanity,  according to this,
cannot help what it is doing.
    The structure  of Vonnegut's novels  itself reveals the  fact
that everything is set and the characters have no way of changing
the storyline. The  plot is usually revealed in  the first couple
of chapters, you almost always  know what's going to happen next.
The  narrator often  occupies a  vantage point  for observing the
whole story. In <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, for instance, it is the view
of Tralfamadorians who see in the fourth dimension, therefore see
everything that's happened and that  will happen. In <i>Gal pagos</i> it
is the viewpoint  of a ghost narrating the  story a million years
after  it  actually  happened,  therefore  seeing  it from a very
similar point to the Tralfamadorians'.
    If there is a puppet which is actually doing something, there
also must  be a puppet master.  It is difficult to  recognize the
puppet master, though. The 'enormous force' (SH5:164), the source
of all acts of Humanity differs  from book to book. In <i>Gal pagos</i>,
as has  been mentioned, it  is the people's  big brains. In  some
other books (eg. HOC, BOC, DED),  it is chemicals or fault in the
'construction' of the human being: "It is a big temptation to me,
when I create a character for a  novel, to say that he is what he
is because of faulty wiring, or because of microscopic amounts of
chemicals which he ate or failed  to eat on that particular day."
(BOC:4) Some of the most gruesome accidents, says Vonnegut, "were
caused  by  people  who  had  rendered  themselves  imbecillic or
maniacal  because by  ingesting too   much of  what, if  taken by
moderation,  could  be  a  helpful  chemical."  (HOC:28). In some
novels it  is the sexual drive  or other physical needs.  The key
word  is probably  the word  'physical'. Vonnegut  often sees the
fault in the body. In <i>Bluebeard</i>,  for example, that fault is seen
in the 'meat':  "I would hate to be responsible  for what my meat
does."  When people  do something  terrible, it  is the  'meat's'
fault. (BLU:246)
    On the  other hand, in Breakfast  of Champions Vonnegut muses
about the  idea of God being  the cause. He uses  a parallel: the
'destructive testing division' at the Pontiac Division of General
Motors, where

              various  parts  of   automobiles  and  even  entire
         automobiles  were  destroyed.   Pontiac  scientists  set
         upholstery on fire, threw gravel at windshields, snapped
         crankshafts and driveshafts,  staged head-on collisions,
         tore gearshift  levers out by the  roots, ran engines at
         high  speeds  with  almost  no  lubrication,  opened and
         closed glove compartment doors  a hundred times a minute
         for  days,  cooled  dashboard  clocks  to  within  a few
         degrees of absolute zero, and so on.
              Everything you're not supposed to do to a car, they
         did to a car. (BOC:165-166)

Vonnegut wonders  if this is  the reason what  God put people  on
earth for,  whether it was to  test them how much  they can stand
without  breaking  (BOC:166).  From  the  novel  it seems that he
thinks that this is, obviously, the reason.
    After all,  Vonnegut seems to imply,  Divinity is the creator
of the 'meat' and the designer  of the 'big brain', both of which
a human  being cannot  control, both  of which  a human  being is
subject  to. Another  clue of  Divinity being  the source  can be
seen: If Divinity created the whole reality, then it is the maker
of the amber as well. What are people predestined to do must have
been  predestined by  Divinity,  the  creator. Vonnegut  may also
refer  to  the  Biblical  quality  of  God,  who sees everything:
everything that is, everything that was and everything that is to
come;  who knows  what people  are going  to do  next; who  plans
people's lives. However, Vonnegut  does not allow the possibility
to avoid  God's plans, does not  acknowledge the Christian 'right
to choose'.

<b>Vonnegut Playing the God</b>
    In <i>Breakfast of Champions</i>, Vonnegut himself plays the part of
Divinity. He assumes a role  that, in my opinion, illustrates the
role of  Divinity in his  other books. He  is the creator  of the
amber,  the storyline.  He is  the creator  of the characters. He
decides   what  the   characters  will   do  next.   He  is   the
puppet-master  leading his  puppets. The  characters are  utterly
under his control. The only  character that seems to realize this
is Kilgore Trout,  who says to his parakeet:  "the way things are
going, all I  can think of is that  I'm a character in a  book by
somebody who  wants to write  about somebody who  suffers all the
time" (BOC:241).
    The parallel  between this and  other Vonnegut's novels  (and
Vonnegut's life itself) can be easily seen. Humanity is suffering
and  it feels  like a  character under  the hand  of somebody who
likes to write about suffering.

<b>The Big Brain of Humanity</b>
    In <i>Gal pagos</i>,  the cause of everything  an individual does is
the oversized  human brain. It  is what leads  him/her into doing
terrible,  abominable things,  it is  something s/he  cannot help
obeying. According to what has  been discucced in this section so
far, the cause of everything  Humanity does seems to be Divinity.
Therefore,  Divinity  appears  to  be  the  'oversize  brain'  of
Humanity.  If  we  compare  the  relation  of  an  individual and
his/her  brain  to  the  relation  of  Humanity  and  Divinity in
Vonnegut's  novels, we  see an  almost perfect  match. <i>Gal pagos</i>,
which, as an exception, does not  blame God for anything, can now
be  seen as  a parable  of the  relation between  people and God,
actually  putting  even  more  blame  on  Divinity than any other
novel.

<b>Summing Up Divinity</b>
    This  section  has  shown  that  Divinity  is  the  cause  of
evrything Humanity  does. Sometimes it is  just hidden behind the
'minor sources' (e.g. fate,  faulty construction of human bodies,
oversize brains, people's reaction  to chemicals, sex drive etc.)
and  sometimes  directly  pointed  out  as  the  Master Puppeteer
leading  its  puppets.  This  part  of  the  essay has shown that
Divinity is the  highest force, the designer of  the 'amber', the
author  of  the  tragedies  of  human  lives,  the  Big  Brain of
Humanity. Humanity seems not to  be given any free will, anything
that would make its life worth living.
