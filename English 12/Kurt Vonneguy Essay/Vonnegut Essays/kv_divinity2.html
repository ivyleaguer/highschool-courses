<b><u>Humanity</u></b>
    The first character  that is going to become  a subject to my
X-ray analysis is Humanity. Vonnegut usually repeats himself over
and over again  in defining and describing human  beings. He uses
similar attributes of Humanity  throughout his books and stories.
There  is  a  number  of  positive  qualities that Vonnegut often
highlights  in  his  works,  but  these  are  mostly overruled by
negative  qualities. On  the reader,  this leaves  the impression
that  Humanity is  the villain.   I will  try to  contradict this
impression by  and by. Let  me begin with  physical appearance of
his characters and  work my way slowly to  more complex qualities
of Vonnegut's Humanity.

<b>Physical appearance</b>
    Physical  appearance of  most Vonnegut's  human characters is
surprisingly very similar.  He makes all the people  in his works
appear ridiculous. About Billy Pilgrim, the main character of his
Slaughterhouse Five,  he says: "He was  a funny-looking child who
became  a funny-looking  youth--tall  and  weak, and  shaped like
a bottle  of Coca-Cola."  (SH5:23) James  Wait, one  of the  main
characters in <i>Galapagos</i>, "was prematurely  bald and he was pudgy,
and  his color  was bad,  like the   crust on  a pie  in a  cheap
cafeteria, and he was  bespectacled," (GAL:6) says Vonnegut. Many
people  in  his  books  are  very  fat,  e.g. Mr. Rosewater (main
character  of  <i>God  Bless  You  Mr.  Rosewater</i>), Rudy Waltz (main
character of <i>Deadeye  Dick</i>), Ruth Starbuck (the wife  of the main
character in <i>Jailbird</i>) and so forth.
    Most  people in  Vonnegut's  books  are not  only charm-free,
cosmetically  challenged,   vertically  challenged,  horizontally
gifted  etc. because  they were  not given  from above, but their
bodies  also  look  deteriorated  by  their  own doing, or should
I say,  lack  of  doing  anything.  Many  of  his  characters are
described as unwashed, unshaved, having  oily hair etc. The ghost
of Kilgore Trout (Vonnegut's favorite character), for example, is
described: "As  in life, he  needed a shave.  As in life,  he was
still  pale  and  haggard.  As  in  life,  he  was  still smoking
a cigarete," (GAL:255)
    Another  aspect   by  which  Vonnegut   often  rudicules  his
characters is making them wear  completely ludicrous or dirty and
ragged  clothes.  Of  course,  they  are  not  constantly dressed
ridiculously -- mostly just in the most important situations. For
example, when the sci-fi writer  Kilgore Trout arrives to Midland
City  for the  grand opening  of an  Arts Center  he looks in the
mirror  and  sees  "a  red-eyed,  filthy  old  creature  who  was
barefoot, who  had his pants  rolled up to  his knees." (BOC:229)
Another good example can be the moment when Walter F. Starbuck in
<i>Jailbird</i> is being let out of prison and he dresses into civillian
clothes and looks in the mirror. Here is who he saw:

              a scrawny old janitor  of Slavic extraction. He was
         unused to wearing a suit and a tie. His shirt collar was
         much too large  for him, and so was  his suit, which fit
         him like a circus tent. He looked unhappy--on his way to
         a relative's funeral, perhaps. At no point was there any
         harmony between himself and the  suit. He may have found
         his clothes in a rich man's ash can. (JAI:66)

The last example  might be Otto Waltz applying  to the Academy of
Fine Arts in Vienna. He

              was told to come back  to the Academy in two weeks,
         at  which time  they would  tell him  whether they would
         take him or not.
              He was  in rags at the  time, with a piece  of rope
         for a belt, and with patched trousers and so on. (DED:4)

    It  would  be  wrong  if  you  understood  that all people in
Vonnegut's books are looking  dirty, ragged and ridiculous. There
are a  couple of exceptions  when people look  nice and tidy  and
beautiful. They  are, however, mostly  minor characters. In  case
you come across a main character that does not look ludicrous, it
is because he/she has not reached the point when Vonnegut decides
to make him/her  look that way. Beautiful wives  get fat and ugly
by  and  by  (e.g.  Walter  Starbuck's  wife  Ruth  in <i>Jailbird</i>),
succesful  people go  downhill and  end up  in rags (e.g. Malachi
Constant in <i>The Sirens of Titan</i> or, again, W. Starbuck).
    Over all,  to get back  to the idea  that all humanity  forms
a literary character,  I would say  that Vonnegut's Humanity  has
a negative (even repulsive) appearance. Even though there appears
a positive quality  every now and then,  these are overwhelmed by
the majority of the former  ones. Moreover, Vonnegut both assigns
this ludicrousness  and ugliness of Humanity  to both the natural
causes and  the Humanity's neglect  of itself. However,  it seems
that  the former  causes are  more characteristic.  It appears as
though Vonnegut intends  to show Humanity in the  worst light, as
miserable as possible.
    You  may point  out that  appearance is  not everything, that
what a  person looks like  is not important,  that it is  what is
inside that counts. You are right. Even Vonnegut admits this when
Walter Starbuck  talks about body  sizes. He says  that it is  an
issue that

              I  am very  reluctant to  discuss--because I  don't
         want  to give  them more  importance than  they deserve.
         Body sizes  can be remarkable for  their variations from
         accepted norms,  but still explain  almost nothing about
         the lives led inside those  bodies. I am small enough to
         to  have been  a coxwain,  as I  have already confessed.
         That explains  nothing. And, by  the time Leland  Clewes
         came to  trial for perjury, my  wife, although only five
         feet tall,  weighed one hundred and  sixty pounds or so.
         So be it. (JAI:70-71)

In  contrast,  however,  Vonnegut  seems  not  to be reluctant to
discuss  these aspects  of Humanity  at all.  His descriptions of
Humanity's appearance is a rather  common and bold feature of his
books.  I   agree  with  W.  Starbuck,   however,  that  physical
appearance does not say anything about the person's character.

<b>Environment</b>
    Before my  X-ray beams will penetrate  deeper into the nature
of  Humanity,  let  me  talk   about  the  environment  in  which
Vonnegut's  character Humanity  lives. Indication  of a  literary
character by  environment often helps  the reader to  form a more
complete picture of the character and I am sure that it will help
in this case as well.
    Vonnegut in his  books talks about people living  both in big
cities and in small towns. It  is hard to tell whether cities are
in  majority or  small towns,  so this  feature probably does not
carry  much weight.  What is  interesting, however,  is that  the
environment   mostly  reflects   the  poor   appearance  of   the
characters. They often  live in houses or apartments  that are in
similar  condition  as  their   appearance.  Kilgore  Trout,  for
example, lived in  a poor basement apartment in  Cohoes, New York
(BOC:20). Walter  F. Starbuck in <i>Jailbird</i>,  after having left the
prison, lives in one of the dirtiest hotels in New York, in Hotel
Arapahoe. In <i>Deadeye  Dick</i> Vonnegut even calls the  house of Rudy
Waltz  (and the  houses of  some other  people) a "shitbox". Even
a multimillionnaire   Eliot   Rosewater   (<i>God   Bless  You,  Mr.
Rosewater</i>) moves to  a small town of Rosewater,  Indiana, to live
in a small cramped office.
    Similarly as  when I was  talking about physical  appearance,
when a  person is not  living in a  decrepit or cramped  house or
apartment, it mostly means only that he/she has not started to go
downhill  yet. Rudy  Walts has  not always  lived in a "shitbox".
Walter F.  Starbuck, similarly, has  not always lived  in a dirty
hotel room. On the contrary:  these people were mostly fabulously
well-to-do.
    Humanity as  a character also  lives in a  decrepit, cramped,
dirty old house -- the Earth.  In perhaps all Vonnegut's books he
constantly  alludes to  the  Earth's  being heavily  polluted and
nearly  destroyed.  We  can  see  the  analogy here: Humanity was
"fabulously  well-to-do" in  the beginning  but it  has taken the
course  downhill.  However,  I  will  deal  more with ecology and
pollution  in one  of the   following sections  of this  paper in
connection with another aspect of Humanity.
    Overall, Vonnegut  again seems to intend  to create the image
of Humanity's utter misery. Also,  it appears that Vonnegut wants
to illustrate  the direction in  which Humanity proceeds  in many
ways, which is -- downhill.

<b>The Fruits of Humanity's Existence</b>
    Let  me now  proceed to  perhaps most  startling facts  about
Humanity revealed by Kurt Vonnegut. I have already dealt with how
people in  Vonnegut's works look  like and where  they live. Now,
I will  talk  about  what  people   do.  Vonnegut  in  his  books
constantly attacks many vices thought up or created by men. There
are  two  vices  about  which  Vonnegut  gets  most  bitter:  war
(Vonnegut served  in one himself)  and ecological disaster.  "The
more you  learn about people, the  more disgusted you'll become,"
says  the ghost  of Kilgore  Trout to  the ghost  of his son Leon
Trout, who served in the war of Vietnam.

              "I would  have thought that your  being sent by the
         wisest  men  in  your   country,  supposedly,  to  fight
         a nearly  endless, thankless,  horrifying, and, finally,
         pointless war,  would have given  you sufficient insight
         into the  nature of humanity to  last you throughout all
         eternity."

Kilgore Trout continues,

              "Need I tell you that these same wonderful animals,
         of  which you  apparently still  want to  learn more and
         more,  are at  this very  moment proud  as Punch to have
         weapons in  place, all set  to go at  a moment's notice,
         guarranteed to kill everything?" (GAL:254)

These are not the only  bitter words Vonnegut expresses about the
issue of  wars. However, in  my opinion, they  are sufficient for
demonstration. I will  use the same speech of a  ghost to a ghost
for demonstrating  Vonnegut's bitternes about the  latter vice as
well.

              "Need  I  tell  you  that  this  once beautiful and
         nourishing planet when viewed from the air now resembles
         the diseased organs of poor  Roy Hepburn when exposed at
         his autopsy, and that  the apparent cancers, growing for
         the  sake  of  growth   alone,  and  consuming  all  and
         poisoning  all, are  the  cities  of your  beloved human
         beings?
              "Need I tell you that  these animals have made such
         a botch of things that they can no longer imagine decent
         lives  for  their  own  grandchildren,  even,  and  will
         consider it a  miracle if there is anything  left to eat
         or  enjoy by  the year  two thousand,  now only fourteen
         years away?" (GAL:254)

    Vonnegut, however does not attack only these things in modern
society.  There  are  many  more  targets  of  his bitterness and
anguish,  e.g. racism,  jingoism, commercial  greed, slavery etc.
etc.
    This indicates that Vonnegut presents this literary character
of his,  Humanity, as the villain.  Humanity is the cause  of all
these things  I have mentioned. Humanity  is to blame, Vonnegut's
books seem to suggest.

<b>Fatal Lusts</b>
    Now  that I  described how  Humanity behaves,  what it is the
source of, I will deal with the question "What drives Humanity to
behave in such a way?  What makes Humanity 'tick' so abominably?"
Vonnegut presents  two main drives of  Humanity's misbehavior. He
calls  these  incentives  'monsters'   and  rightly  so.  "Lions?
Tigers?"  he asks.  The answer  is "no."  He says  that lions and
tigers are asleep  most of the time and that  the monsters he has
in mind never sleep. He says  that they inhabit our heads and our
minds.  They  are  "the  arbitrary  lusts  for  gold" and "girl's
underpants".  (BOC:25).  Vonnegut  often  writes  about  one more
monster  that  proves  to  be  as  dangerously destructive as the
already  mentioned  two.  This   monster  is  ambition.  However,
ambition  seems to  stand hand   in hand  with greed  for wealth.
I will now deal with the two lusts separately.

<b>Money</b>
    Gold seems to  be the most often expressed  lust of Humanity.
Humanity's  greed  for  money  appears  almost  in all Vonnegut's
novels. <i>God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater</i> opens with this statement:

              A sum of money is  a leading character in this tale
         about people, just  as a sum of honey  might properly be
         a leading character in a tale about bees. (ROS:7)

A  similar example may be found in <i>The Sirens of Titan</i>, where the
main character  looks at his solar  watch: "He held his  watch to
sunlight, letting it  drink in the wherewithal that  was to solar
watches what money was to Earth men." (TIT:14)
    These two excerpts certainly illustrate the importance people
assign to money. They assign more value to money and gold than to
fellow human  beings. Compared to money,  human beings lose their
value  as  Vonnegut  points  out  for  example in <i>Galapagos</i>, when
Ecuador undergoes an economical crisis:

              Ecuador, after all, like the Galapagos Islands, was
         mostly lava and ash, and so  could not begin to feed its
         nine million  people. It was  bankrupt, and so  could no
         longer buy  food from countries with  plenty of topsoil,
         so  the seaport  of Guayaquil  was idle,  and the people
         were  beginning   to  starve  to   death.  Business  was
         business. (GAL:23)

In <i>Deadeye Dick</i>, Midland City's  population is entirely wiped out
by an  explosion of a neutron  bomb. This weapon causes  only the
death of all living beings and leaves all the property untouched.
Ironically,  Vonnegut  asks  whether  it  matters  that all those
people died  so suddenly. "Since  all the property  is undamaged,
has the world  lost anything it loved?" (DED:34)  If you consider
what  I have  written about  Humanity so  far, you  will find the
answer yourself.
    I  can almost  hear the  ringing  of  this outcry  in my  and
Vonnegut's ears:  "Wake up, you  idiots! Whatever made  you think
paper  was so  valuable?" (GAL:24)  Whatever made  Humanity think
that things (of any sort) were so valuable, for that matter?
    This part of  the essay, similarly as the  previous ones, has
shown that  Vonnegut tends to  present humanity in  the worst way
possible.  However, there  are exceptions.  The most  outstanding
exception  is  the  novel  <i>God  Bless  You,  Mr.  Rosewater</i> which
suggests that there still are good people in the world, that even
in a world  spoiled by greed and money,  there is the possibility
of doing good by means of money. A man who managed to do this was
Eliot Rosewater who took the inherited wealth and started helping
people.

<b>Underpants</b>
    Another  thing  that  drives  human  beings  is  sexual lust,
Vonnegut  says. He  suggests that  people's inability  to control
their animal drives  leads the planet into doom,  mostly by means
of overpopulation.
    Mary  Hepburn,  one  of  the  main  characters  in <i>Galapagos</i>,
describes,  for example,  "how easily  a teenage  virgin could be
made  pregnant by  the seed  of  a  male who  was seeking  sexual
release and nothing  else, who did not even  like her." (GAL:124)
In <i>Breakfast of Champions</i> Vonnegut points out that most countries
are in such a miserable condition that there is no more space for
people and that the people have nothing to eat. And still they go
on having  sexual intercourse which  is, as Vonnegut  reminds us,
how  babies  are  made.  "More   babies  were  arriving  all  the
time--kicking and screaming, yelling for milk." (BOC:12-13)
    With  tongue in  his cheek,  Vonnegut shows  that 'babies' is
a wonderful way of overcoming wars,  that even after long lasting
wars  there still  always seems   to be  plenty of  people around
(GAL:33).  This,  however,  encourages  many  people  to think of
murdering, wiping  out cities etc.  "as show business,  as highly
theatrical forms of self-expression, and little more." (GAL:33)
    Humanity,  evidently,  as  Kurt  Vonnegut  describes  it,  is
producing more  than it can sustain,  yet it is ignorant  of this
fact. "Just  because something can reproduce,  that does not mean
that  it should  reproduce," (HOC:49)  is what  Vonnegut probably
tries  to  say  over  and  over  again. Otherwise, Humanity could
suffocate. The  word "locusts" also  comes into mind;  or "Planet
Gobblers"  for that  matter. "Planet  Gobblers" is  a short story
written by Kilgore Trout. The story was

              about us, and we were  the terrors of the universe.
         We were sort of interplanetary termites. We would arrive
         on a planet, gobble it up,  and die. But before we died,
         we   sent  out   spaceships  to   start  tiny   colonies
         elsewhere... (PS:209)

Humanity, however, does not realize  that there is only Earth and
after it gobbles  up this planet, there will be  no more food, no
more planets to gobble up.
    To  sum up,  Humanity is  shown  to  be driven  by two  fatal
forces: money and sex. Both these forces are given about the same
weight  as the  greatest impediments  to nice  and decent life on
Earth.

<b>Big brains</b>
    Vonnegut does  not only describe  the drives of  Humanity, he
even uncovers the source of these lusts and of all the bad things
Humanity  does. In  GAL,  the  source is  Humanity's imagination,
destructive ideas, their oversized  brains. "If catastrophe comes
more  easily  to  man  than  courtesy  and decency," <i>Contemporary
Authors</i> suggests, "man's large  brain is to blame." (<i>Contemporary
Authors</i>,49) "Can  it be doubted  that three kilogram  brains were
once nearly  fatal defects in  the evolution of  the human race?"
(GAL:8) Vonnegut  asks. He asserts  that the planet  is basically
innocent, "except for those big brains." (GAL:9) These brains are
"irresposible,    unreliable,    hideously    dangerous,   wholly
unrealistic" and they are "simply no damn good." (GAL:25)
    These brains make people lie,  for example (GAL:67). They are
the "irresponsible generators of suggestions  as to what might be
done with life" (GAL:78). They  generate crazy ideas in the heads
of human beings who cannot  help but realize them. Vonnegut calls
this aspect of human brains "diabolical" (GAL:266).

              They would  tell their owners,  in effect "Here  is
         a crazy  thing we  could actually  do, probably,  but we
         would  never do  it, of  course. It's  just fun to think
         about."
              And then,  as though in  trances, the people  would
         really do it--have slaves fight  each other to the Death
         in  the Colloseum,  or burn  people alive  in the public
         square   for   holding   opinions   which  were  locally
         unpopular, or build factories  whose only purpose was to
         kill  people in  industrial  quantities,  or to  blow up
         whole cities, and on and on." (GAL:266)

    Even Kilgore  Trout realizes in  <i>Breakfast of Champions</i>  that
evil is  put into the  world in the  form of bad  ideas. (BOC:15)
Furthermore, Vonnegut illustrates the danger of wild ideas on the
saying "If wishes were horses, beggars would ride." He shows that
since  people discovered  tools (and  weapons, consequently) "the
homicidal  beggars  could  ride"   (BOC:28).  In  simpler  words,
Humanity managed to make its  wishes (crazy ideas etc.) come true
and thus doomed itself.

<b>Machines</b>
    Another quality  of Humanity is seen  when Vonnegut describes
people as  machines. The impulses  by which the  reader forms the
image of Humanity  as a machine are both  direct and indirect. In
<i>Sirens  of  Titan</i>  Vonnegut  explains  the  term  machine. In his
opinion, to be a machine is to be vulgar, to lack sensitivity and
imagination, and to be "purposeful without a shred of conscience"
(TIT:200). These  traits, or most  of them, can  be recognized in
most human characters in Vonnegut's books.
    Humanity's  vulgarity  is  obvious  from  perhaps  everything
Vonnegut has written: from how people talk and how they act, from
their 'animal' attitude towards sex etc.
    Lack  of sensitivity  is also  a very  often used  quality of
humans. Vonnegut  demonstrates this by many  ways: the previously
mentioned  Humanity's  attitude  towards  sex (lacking sesitivity
altogether), human  greed (people are not  stopped by anything in
their chase for  silver and gold) and the  ever present shadow of
war  when people  forget the  value of  Human life altogether and
turn into "homicidal imbeciles" (HOC:3).
    That  people are  purposeful is  also a  very often expressed
quality  of  humans.  People  keep  doing  what  they  seem to be
programmed for, what  they seem to be designed  for. One of these
purposes is surely the already mentioned reproduction. An example
of this can be found, for example, in <i>Deadeye Dick</i>:

              The  actress playing  Celia could  ask why  God had
         even put her on Earth.
              And  then the  voice from  the back  of the theater
         could  rumble:   "To  reproduce.  Nothing   else  really
         interests Me. All the rest is frippery." (DED:185)

Another aspect of Vonnegut's novels that can hint at the issue of
purposefulness is people's being reduced into unthinking entities
by various  institutions. People are  often seen as  robots under
orders, willing to  do anything. One of the  most often described
institutions is surely the army,  because Vonnegut still seems to
be haunted by his experience from  World War II. For example, the
main character in HOC says that he was a professional soldier and
would  have  killed  the  returning  Jesus  Christ  if ordered by
a superior officer (HOC:2). In <i>Sirens of Titan</i> Vonnegut describes
soldiers  as people  with antenna  in their  heads, controlled by
radio to do anything the commander chooses (TIT:63).
    These are  not the only  ways Vonnegut uses  to show people's
purposefulness.  There is  a hint  at  it  in each  book by  him.
However, this aspect will be dealt with later in the essay.
    The only exception from the  traits of 'a machine' applied to
Humanity would probably be the  lack of imagination. It cannot be
said  that   Vonnegut's  characters  lack   imagination.  On  the
contrary,  he often  emphasizes human  imagination. This  aspect,
however, will  also be dealt  with later. It  is, in my  opinion,
a crucial quality of Vonnegut's Humanity.
    This chapter  has so far  dealt with indirect  indications of
people's being  machines. However, this trait  is also very often
defined in  the text directly. This  direct definition is perhaps
most  common  in  <i>Breakfast  of  Champions</i>.  One  of  the Kilgore
Trout's books  (which plays a major  part in this novel),  Now It
Can Be Told says that all  people, all living things are machines
and  the only  entity with  free will  is the  reader of the book
(BOC:173-5, 253-7). Another example is the people being seen from
the viewpoint  of Tralfamadorians (Vonnegut's  favorite 'race' of
aliens). These beings see  everything what happens, what happened
and what will happen, at the same time.

              Lionel  Merble was  a machine.  Tralfamadorians, of
         course,  say  that  every  creature  and  plant  in  the
         Universe  is  a  machine.  It  amuses  them that so many
         Earthlings are offended by the idea of being machines.
              Outside  the  plane,  the  machine  named  Valencia
         Merble  Pilgrim was  eating a  Peter Paul  Mound Bar and
         waving bye-bye. (SH5:154)

Another  way  of  direct  definition  of  this character trait is
considering  the  parts  of  human   body  to  be  components  of
a machine.  Talking about  anatomy Vonnegut  often uses  words as
wires, motors, switches, computers etc. (e.g. BOC:3).
    To sum up, Vonnegut argues that "human beings are robots, are
machines"   (BOC:3).  He   both  indicates   this  directly   and
indirectly. Vonnegut also provides a 'formula' (defining the term
'machine')  by  which  the  reader  can  see  this by him/herself
(TIT:200). There  is, however, one  element in the  formula, into
which the image  of humanity does not fit.  This element is human
imagination.

<b>Summing up Humanity</b>
    This  part  of  the  essay  has  shown  the  overall image of
Humanity in  Vonnegut's books. It  has illustrated that  Humanity
(as a literary character) is ugly, dirty, funny-looking, fat etc.
It has  been born with  some of these  qualities, and the  others
were caused by Humanity neglecting itself. The environment, where
Humanity lives  is as miserable  as its physical  appearance: the
Earth has turned into a  cramped, neglected, dirty, smelly place.
These  negative qualities  are, however,  strongly overpowered by
'inner'  qualities.   Humanity  is  seen  as   a  machine  moving
incontrollably forward, driven by  several 'fatal lusts' (such as
greed  for money  and wealth,  ambition, sex).  The machine never
stops, decency  is unimportant, human lives  are unimportant. The
'monster' moves  onward, destroying everything  that gets in  its
way.  However, the  machine also  seems to  be driven  by a  much
higher force, by something completely out of Humanity's control.
