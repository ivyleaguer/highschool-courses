<b>Windows into the psyche of Kurt Vonnegut</b>
Tim Heck

     Kurt Vonnegut is one of  the preeminent writers of the later
half of the twentieth century. His works are all windows into his
mind, a literary psychoanalysis. He  examines himself as a cog in
the corporate machine in "Deer in the Works"; as a writer through
the eyes of Kilgore Trout in several works; and most importantly,
as a prisoner of war in <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>.
     Vonnegut created  short stories and  novels that dealt  with
events in his life. One of  the most obvious self examinations is
in  "Deer  in  the  Works".  The  short  story  is  based  on his
experiences  as  a  publicist  at  the  General  Electric Company
Research Laboratory in Schenectady, New York. "Deer in the Works"
takes  place over  two days  in the  life of  David Potter  as he
begins his employment at the Ilium Works of the Federal Apparatus
Corporation. He is  assigned to cover a deer  trapped in a remote
corner of  the Works. Potter gets  lost in the Works  himself and
feels just as  trapped as the deer. He  eventually frees the deer
and escapes the  works to return to his  newspaper. Vonnegut felt
trapped like  Potter does, and  left General Electric  in 1951 to
write full time.
     Before  World  War  II,  Vonnegut  was  enrolled  at Cornell
University studying biochemistry. He was surrounded by scientists
and machines and as a result, his first literary works were based
on that influence. Vonnegutøs early writings were not accepted as
serious, mainstream literature due to their scientific nature. He
was considered a science fiction writer by literary critics. That
label caused him to be largely ignored.
     He created  the character Kilgore  Trout, a science  fiction
writer, to  examine the literary  worldøs view of  himself. Trout
first appeared in <i>God Bless  You, Mr. Rosewater</i>, and has appeared
in every single subsequent major work of Vonnegutøs. Trout is the
author of two-hundred novels and  thousands of short stories. He,
like  Vonnegut was,  is largely  ignored. Vonnegut  used Trout to
explore  his  thoughts  on  being  labeled  inaccurately,  and as
a writer living  in near obscurity. In  the preface to <i>Timequake,
</i>Vonnegut states that Kilgore Trout  was his "alter ego in several
of my other novels" (xiii).
     In  1975,  a  novel  entitled  <i>Venus  on  the Half Shell</i> was
published  by  "Kilgore  Trout".  Many  thought  that "Trout" was
Vonnegut  himself, because  the title  of the  book was  one that
Vonnegut had  attributed to Trout.  The author was  not Vonnegut,
but rather Philip Jose Farmer.  The publishing of the book proved
to Vonnegut that the fame accorded to him was real and after that
he  stopped  using  Kilgore  Trout  to  examine  his  thoughts on
obscurity and science fiction.

     A major event  in Vonnegutøs life was his  being captured by
the Germans  during the Battle of  the Bulge in World  War II. He
was  an  infantry  scout  lost  in  enemy  territory  when he was
captured  on December  22, 1944.  Taken to  the city  of Dresden,
Germany, he was put to work in a factory that made malt syrup for
pregnant women. "There, on the night of February 13, 1945, he was
sheltered  in  an  underground   meat  locker  while  the  Allies
unleashed one of the most relentless  air raids of the war" (Reed
755). The raid killed 35,000 civilians.
     Vonnegut  emerged from  the meat  locker to  find a scene he
later  described  in  <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>   as  "like  the  moon"
(Slaughterhouse   179).  The   historic  city   of  Dresden   was
pock-marked by  bomb craters; its  inhabitants ceased to  be. The
city  had the  desolate look  of the  moon, void  of human  life.
Vonnegut, along  with other prisoners, was  forced to dig through
the rubble  to find bodies and  bring them to funeral  pyres. The
shock of  the bombing to  the 22 year-old  Vonnegut could not  be
fully  dealt with  until 1968-twenty  three years  later, when he
began to  write <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>. In  1968, Vonnegut "returned
to Dresden with his fellow  POW Bernard OøHare to gather material
for the book" (Boomhower 5). There  he began to recall the events
that occurred there in 1945.
     The protagonist of <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> is Billy Pilgrim. His
situation in the war was  identical to Vonnegutøs, and Pilgrim is
used by Vonnegut to examine what happened in Dresden. Pilgrim has
the ability  to travel in  time, the manifestation  of Vonnegutøs
1968  trip to  Dresden. Pilgrim   relives the  night the  city of
Dresden was destroyed, and ponders the uselessness of the act.
     After  the   publishing  of  <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>   in  1969,
Vonnegut told  <i>Playboy,</i> "I didnøt have to write at all anymore if
I didnøt  want  to"  (Wampeters  280). <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> helped
Kurt Vonnegut lay  to rest some of the  memories that had haunted
him since 1945.
     Vonnegut later claimed,

           "The  importance  of  Dresden  in  my  life  has  been
           considerably  exaggerated  because  my  book  about it
           became a best  seller. If the book hadnøt  been a best
           seller, it would seem like  a very minor experience in
           my life. And I donøt  think peopleøs lives are changed
           by   short-term   events   like   that.   Dresden  was
           astonishing,   but  experiences   can  be  astonishing
           without changing you" (Reed 776).

Despite these claims to the  contrary, the experiences at Dresden
had always played a large part in his writings.
     His experiences  have always shaped  what Kurt Vonnegut  has
written. He  said to his brother,  Bernard, that he wrote  for an
audience of one, his dead sister; but he truly wrote for himself.
He   wrote    about   his   experiences   as    a   prisoner   in
<i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>,  as a  publicist in  a major  corporation in
"Deer  in  the  Works",  and  as  a  writer through the character
Kilgore Trout. Vonnegut examined his thoughts through the eyes of
David Potter, Kilgore Trout, and Billy Pilgrim. His works are all
deeply personal windows into the psyche of Kurt Vonnegut.
