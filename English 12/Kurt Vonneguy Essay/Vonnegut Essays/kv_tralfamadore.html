<b>The Tralfamadorian Paradigm</b>
Nicholas Kelleher

      Slaughterhouse Five, by Kurt Vonnegut,  is a novel in which
the laws of physics are  broken -- apparently. Billy Pilgrim, the
main  character, is  loose in  time and  is free,  though not  in
control,  to experience  any moment  of his  life, including  the
moments before he was born and after he dies (experienced as hues
with sustained sounds).  At random times in the  main sequence of
his life  he literally jumps  to other times,  something which he
is  fully aware of. He can be on Tralfamadore one moment, back on
earth  with his  wife the  next. This  could be  puzzling to  the
cursory reader, but Vonnegut makes  sure to spell out his reasons
why  such events  can be  believed as  realistic and perceived as
happening,  to  some  extent,  to  everyone  everywhere -- at all
times. The  Tralfamadorians, who explain this  nature of time and
existence to Billy, are shown  as enlightened creatures while the
humans back on  earth are seen as backwards --  to such an extent
that they believe in free will. Billy towards the end of his life
becomes a preacher of these virtues of existence taught to him by
his zookeepers  on Tralfamadore, going around  and speaking about
his  experiences and  his  acquired  knowledge. Much  like Billy,
Vonnegut  tries to  preach his  own view  of the  universe and of
existence, but  through fiction. Billy's view  is Vonnegut's view
and  it  is  through  Billy  and  his  experiences  that Vonnegut
explains  its nature  to us.  But the  point here  is not  purely
physical. Vonnegut applies it to  everyday human life through the
events  in the  novel, and  in a  strange twist, this application
leads to a philosophy that Billy does not actually embolden.

      Through Billy  and the Tralfamadorians  Vonnegut introduces
us to  his ideas on  the nature of  time and physical  existence.
When Billy  travels to Tralfamadore  for the first  time -- after
having been unstuck in time for many years -- he is taught by the
tralfmadorians the nature  of time. They tell him  that the human
perception of time as linear  and flowing with the possibility of
only   one  moment   existing   at   'once'  is   erroneous.  The
Tralfamadorians exist in 4 dimensions  and so have perspective on
time. They tell  Billy that time does not  flow, that all moments
exist concurrently and  it is only an illusion  if they appear to
have any  linearity. This makes  sense to Billy  for he has  been
traveling to odd places in time ever since his experiences in the
war. The Tralfamadorians also have  a philosophy of life based on
their ability to  have perspective on time. They  tell Billy that
it is pointless to be concerned with the bad things always happen
to  us in  our lives.  They say  that it  is wiser  to only focus
one's attention on  the good moments, for no  moments are capable
of  being changed  -- they  just  are.  Billy to  some extent  is
capable of applying this philosophy to his life for he is blessed
enough to  be loose in time  -- and know it.  But Vonnegut may be
saying that we are all loose  in time, for if the Tralfamadorians
are correct, all the moments in our lives exist 'simultaneously.'
And  so whether  or not  we are  aware of  these other moments in
other  moments is  irrelevant to  the fact  that the  moments all
function at the same 'time'.  The universe, with all its moments,
is the same as  when we 'were' babies as it 'is'  now. By the end
of Billy's life  we find him preaching this  knowledge to various
adoring masses. Billy preaches the  philosophy that was taught to
him by the Tralfamadorians.

      Vonnegut seems to be aware,  though, that none of us posses
the abilities that Billy Pilgrim  possesses. We can't visit other
moments in  our lives. We  don't have the  luxury of turning  our
attention away from the present and looking at some other moment.
So as good  as this philosophy of the  Tralfamadorians sounds, it
doesn't  seem  to  be  reconcilable  with  our  humanness.  It is
possible  that this  philosophy was  a reaction  to the troubling
experiences that Billy and -- through the novel -- Vonnegut ha ve
had. Billy may have experienced  more hardship than Vonnegut did,
and  his   apparent  traversals  through   time  and  visits   to
Tralfamadore may have all been illusory, may have acted as a sort
of coping mechanism. But Vonnegut  did experience the War and the
fire bombing of Dresden. Vonnegut  states in the beginning of the
novel that trying to stop a war is like trying to stop an iceberg
--  it   cannot  be  done.   If  humans  were   gifted  like  the
Tralfamadorians  are,  then  they  would  know  for  a  fact  the
parallels between  war and icebergs because  all moments past and
present are immutable. They would view all of existence like they
view  the iceberg  metaphor. Of  course, humans  don't have these
abilities   anywhere   near   to   the   extent   to   which  the
Tralfamadorians  have  them  (Human  artistic  vision  and  other
faculties  resemble  the  Tralfamadorian  abilities,  and  we are
blessed to be aware of stretches  of time, not just living solely
in the  moment.) By the end  of the novel it  seems that Vonnegut
comes to  terms with these limitations.  The pendant that Montana
Wildhack,  Billy's human  zoo-mate on  Tralfamadore, was  wearing
sums  it up  nicely. It  states: "God  grant me  the serenity  to
accept the things  I cannot change, courage to  change the things
I can and wisdom to tell the difference." The 'God' in this motto
could be  anything, so when  we view it  in terms of  Vonnegut we
don't have to ascribe any sort  of religiosity. God, if you will,
could be  time and all  of its moments.  And taken as  such, this
motto becomes  a simple wish expressing  some of the limitations,
as Vonnegut sees it, of the human race, and of the human solution
to these  limitations -- an  aspiration to know  one's limits and
abilities and will enough to act accordingly.

       Whether or not Billy actually traveled to Tralfamadore, it
should  not serve  to bolster  or denigrate  the substance of his
message.  If we  understand what  is meant  by the Tralfamadorian
paradigm -- the  philosophy of life based on  the ability to have
time-breaching perspective in four dimensions  -- and we see that
the  facts of  the physical  universe as  stated to  Billy by the
Tralfamadorians --  time and all  its moments being  all-existent
and  immutable, etc.  -- are  believable, we  can understand  our
limitations. To Billy wars are  unstoppable but to the optimistic
human they  aren't. Vonnegut realizes  this, it seems,  and as an
aside, it  may have been what  enabled him to ultimately  come to
terms with  his experiences -- especially  the events surrounding
Dresden.  The two  philosophies are  very complimentary, however.
Billy  had  the  advantage.  He  was  right  to  put on a passive
attitude most of the time if he wasn't insane; but the optimistic
philosophy derived later on doesn't  try to discount the facts of
the  physical universe  propagated  by  the Tralfamadorians -- it
realizes  how absurd  it would  be to  try to  grasp them  as the
Tralfamadorians  are  able  to  and   so  makes  cinders  of  its
philosophical  import and  constructs one  of its  own that fully
considers the human condition. It's sad to say, but Billy Pilgrim
probably was  insane. I don't  think I'd want  to be like  Billy,
jumping schizophrenically from time to  time, but I wouldn't mind
giving a go at being Tralfamadorian.
