<b>A Life Worth Living</b>
Nick McDowell

        Kurt  Vonnegut  (1922-  )  is  an  author  with  a unique
perspective  on life.  He sees  in a  vivid technicolor things in
this world  that the rest of  humanity may only see  in black and
white. By the  same token he sees life as  a rather dark subject,
it's  the ultimate  joke at  our expense  (Lundquist 1). His life
experience has been one of hardship. His mother committed suicide
in 1942.  Two years later he  was captured by Nazis  in World War
II's epic Battle of the Bulge.  In 1943 he survived the massively
destructive  fire-bombing of  Dresden, Germany.  He returned with
the  distinguished   Purple  Heart.  In   1958  his  sister   and
brother-in-law died,  leaving him to raise  their children, along
with his  own (Campbell 2). Despite  these hardships, however, to
Vonnegut  life is  still worth  living. It  shows through  in his
novels.  Vonnegut utilizes  black humor  and irony  to show  many
recurring themes noted in his works which are we, as a race, must
learn to keep happy illusions over  evil ones and that a soothing
lie is sometimes the best truth (Lundquist 1).
        To say  that Vonnegut feels life  is worth living despite
the horrors of the world is to say that Vonnegut really longs for
the  life of  his childhood.  It was  a life  of family and good,
Midwestern  upbringing.  Wholesome  morals  like self-respect and
pacifism were fed to him along with other staples of the Midwest.

           America  was an  idealistic, pacifistic  nation at the
     time. I  was taught in the  sixth grade to be  proud that we
     had a standing army of just  over a hundred thousand men and
     that  generals had  nothing to  say about  what was  done in
     Washington. I  was taught to  be proud of  that and to  pity
     Europe  for having  more than  a million  men under arms and
     spending all  their money on  airplanes and tanks.  I simply
     never unlearned junior civics. I  still believe in it. I got
     a very good grade (Lundquist 2-3).

        In  fact, in  each of  his novels  there is  at least one
character  from  his  native  region.  This  can  be  compared to
director Alfred  Hitchcock's practice of  self cameos on  screen.
The core of his novels usually attacks corruption in the heart of
humanity.  Evils  such  as  pornography,  war  and  pollution are
bombarded with satiric views and patronizing notes. These attacks
can  be  argued  as  something  unique  to  his style or, rather,
a style that  reveals a homesick  author. He is  homesick for the
life of  old when there was  a bold line between  right and wrong
(Lundquist 4).
        It  is  ironic,  however,  that  in  most  of  his novels
a character  described as  Vonnegut's alter  ego, Kilgore  Trout,
keeps  resurfacing.  Kilgore  Trout  is  a  poor  science-fiction
writer,  an  ugly  old  man  whose  works  are  published only in
pornographic magazines  (Schatt 105). It seems  funny to Vonnegut
that  even though  his own  views on  pornography are  said to be
pointed, his alter ego's only form  of expression is to write for
pornographic magazines.
        Trout's stories  are a refreshing bit  of comic relief in
Vonnegut's novels. Trout's stories are also exhibited by Vonnegut
to further show the irony of  the current situation in the novel.
In   Vonnegut's  <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>,   a  novel   about  a  time
travelling veteran named Billy Pilgrim, Trout tells a story about
a man who  built a time machine  so he could see  Jesus. He found
Jesus in the  midst of learning carpentry from  his father at the
age of twelve.

           Two   Roman   soldiers   came   into   the  shop  with
     a mechanical  drawing on  papyrus  of  a device  they wanted
     built by sunrise the next morning. It was a cross to be used
     in the execution of a rabble-rouser.
           Jesus and his father built  it. They were glad to have
     the work. And the rabble-rouser was executed on it.
     So it goes (Vonnegut, Jr. 179).

        In <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>,  Pilgrim has a  soft spot in  his
heart for the science-fiction writer. Trout's book <i>Maniacs in the
Fourth Dimension</i>  is about victims  of an incurable  disease. The
disease is  only incurable, however,  because they exist  only in
the  fourth dimension.  Billy Pilgrim  is an  optometrist and  is
expected  to help  people to   see better.  He is  dubbed insane,
however, because  he sees the  incidents at Dresden  as a typical
example of what  war can do to the winners  as well as the losers
(Schatt 90).
        Another one  of Trout's books  called <i>The Gutless  Wonder
</i>can  also  be  linked  even  closer  to  Pilgrim and his creator,
Vonnegut.  It is  about a  robot who  is ostracized  by the world
because of his bad breath.  He has his halitosis treated, though,
and   quickly   becomes   popular   with   the   humans.  Lacking
a conscience, the  robot drops napalm  on people. This  seemingly
dreadful act  is not protested  by humans though.  "...they found
his halitosis unforgivable.  But then he got that  cleared up and
he was welcomed to the human race" (Schatt 90).
        Here, Vonnegut  shows the futility of  being human. To be
ostracized  for  something  as  menial  as  bad breath, but later
accepted when  it is gone. The  robot does some more  human acts,
acts of violence  that are really typical of  humans. He murders.
No  one complains.  As long  as his  social manner is acceptable,
humans are willing to look the other way.
        Amidst his story telling, though, it should be remembered
that "Vonnegut  is a comic  writer" (Lundquist 17).  He finds the
humor,  black or  otherwise, in  life. Humor  is what  makes life
precious.  In <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>,  Vonnegut tells  the story  of
Pilgrim's  mother. She  had worked  as a  substitute organist for
several  churches, but  had belonged  to none.  She had developed
a longing for a crucifix. On a  trip out West one day, she bought
one she  liked in a gift  shop. This crucifix eventually  came to
rest  in  Billy's  room.  Vonnegut  explains  that  "Like so many
Americans,  she was  trying to  construct a  life that made sense
from things she found in gift shops" (Lundquist 17).
        This side note about Pilgrim's  mother is a prime example
of Vonnegut's style  of black humor. He realizes  that humans try
to "discover or impose order on the pluralistic universe in which
they live"  (Lundquist 17). Billy Pilgrim's  mother obviously has
the drive in  her to make sense of her  world. This is typical of
many  of  Vonnegut's  characters.  It  is  futile  to try to give
meaning  to life.  Vonnegut knows  this and  shows it through his
asides about Billy Pilgrim's mother.  This is his "cosmic irony."
The  prospect of  man's attempt  to bring  order to chaos through
religions, philosophies and science is laughable at best. "In one
way  or  another,  each  of  Vonnegut's  novels  is  an  extended
cosmically ironic joke," (Lundquist 18).
        Vonnegut  admits,  however,  that  he  is  not  rebelling
against organized religion, "I never had any," he said (Lundquist
5). It is ironic, too, that Vonnegut's works hold themes that are
meant  to be  dear to  the heart.  Themes that  touch the soul of
one's desire to make sense of the universe. His themes embody the
essence of religion, yet Vonnegut himself has none.
        In  his book  <i>Cat's Cradle</i>,  Vonnegut ironically  invents
a religion.  It  is  called  Bokonism,  named  for  its  founder,
Bokonon.  To show  even its  futility, its  humorous place in the
grand scheme of things, he writes his own Book of Genesis.

           In the beginning, God created  the earth and He looked
     upon it in His cosmic loneliness (Bryan 4073).

        God then goes on to create man out of mud. Man blinks and
asks the meaning  of it all. "'Everything must  have a purpose?'"
God asked. When man affirms this,  God said, "Then I leave you to
think  of one  for all  this." Then  God walked  away. This gives
a glimpse  into the  mind of  Vonnegut. It  is said that Vonnegut
keeps two messages in his writings.  The first is to be good. The
second is that God doesn't care either way (Bryan 4073).
        In  <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>   Vonnegut  also  uses   a  minor
character to show the craziness  of war. Edgar Derby had survived
both the Battle of the Bulge  and the fire bombing of Dresden. He
later makes  the terrible mistake  of stealing a  teapot from the
ruins  of the  tattered city.  For this  unspeakable crime, he is
tried and shot. This is yet  another example of how Vonnegut uses
irony, with black humor to show  the futility of life. This story
also  shows  the  ambiguities  of  the  human conscience and soul
(Schatt 90).
        In Trout's "Plague on  Wheels" a planet named Lingo-Three
is dying and is inhabited by a people that resemble American cars
and have destroyed all their natural resources. It is appropriate
that Trout's story appears  in Vonnegut's <i>Breakfast of Champions,
</i>a novel about Dwayne Hoover, a Pontiac salesman, whose every sale
brings earth that much closer to death (Schatt 105).
        Another  one   of  Trout's  stories   from  Breakfast  of
Champions  "The Dancing  Fool," shows  the irony  that comes from
miscommunication.

           A flying saucer creature named Zog arrived on Earth to
     explain how  wars could be  prevented and how  cancer can be
     cured. He brought the information from Margo, a planet where
     the natives conversed by means of farts and tap dancing.
           Zog landed  at night in Connecticut.  He had no sooner
     touched down than he saw a house on fire. He rushed into the
     house, farting and tap dancing, warning the people about the
     terrible danger they were in.  The head of the house brained
     Zog with a golf club (Vit 3).

        Inadequacies  of science  are also  relevant in  Vonnegut
novels. In  <i>Breakfast of Champions</i>, a  meeting between a waitress
and Dwayne Hoover comes to pass. Vonnegut interrupts to point out
that  the waitress  had just  read the  tectonic plate  theory of
moving continents. He then goes  on to give the exact measurement
of characters' penises and busts and hips. At first to the reader
these details seem grotesque  and entirely irrelevant. Vonnegut's
interruption,  however,  serves  to  illustrate  a  common  theme
associated with black humor: the futility of science to deal with
human practical problems.

           Knowing that  San Francisco and  Japan are in  hideous
     danger  because  they  are  undergoing tremendous geological
     stress and knowing the exact measurement of Dwayne Hoover do
     not  help  either  the  two  cities  or the Pontiac salesman
     (Schatt 99-100).

        This may  be one reason Vonnegut  prefers science fiction
to real life science. In <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, Pilgrim is abducted
by aliens from  the planet Tralfamadore. When asked  where he was
and how he got there, the Tralfamadorians replied,

           It would take another Earthling  to explain it to you.
     Earthlings  are the  great explainers,  explaining why  this
     event is structured  as it is, telling how  other events may
     be achieved or avoided (Lundquist 51).

        The  Tralfamadorians also  explain the  real meaning  and
concept of time.

           All time is all time. It  does not change. It does not
     lend itself to warnings or  explanations. It simply is. Take
     it moment by  moment, and you will find that  we are all, as
     I've said before, bugs in amber (Lundquist 51).

        The  aliens go  on to  explain that  all moments  in time
happen at once. Therefore, nothing can be done to change the past
or future, because there really is  no past or future. If someone
is dead, the are just technically in bad shape at that particular
moment. By  the same token, they  are quite alive in  another. At
the  conclusion  of  the  novel,  Vonnegut  reflects  on what his
puppets, the Tralfamadorians, had said,

           If what Billy Pilgrim learned from the Tralfamadorians
     is true, that  we will all live forever,  no matter how dead
     we may sometimes  seem to be, I am  not overjoyed. Still--if
     I am going to spend eternity  visiting this moment and that,
     I'm  grateful  that  so  may   of  those  moments  are  nice
     (Lundquist 52).

        Judging by  the preceding events that  make the novel, it
can be surmised  that Vonnegut is being sarcastic.  He knows that
if that theory is true, then really all of the moments in history
will  go on  forever. Lundquist  reveals that  he turned his book
about Dresden into a story with a "horrible twist--if we all live
forever, so  too will the  fire-bombing of Dresden  go on forever
(52).
        On the subject of black humor, Vonnegut noted that

           One day  I was sitting  on the beach  at Cape Cod  and
     this enormous bell jar was lowered  over me and I managed to
     read  the  label.  It  said,   'Black  Humor  by  Bruce  Jay
     Friedman.' I find the label mystifying (Bryan 4073).

        Vonnegut is  referring to a paperback  anthology of bleak
and comical writers by Bruce Jay Friedman. Black humor is more of
a state of  mind than anything. It  was connected to much  of the
turmoil  that arose  from the  1960's, politically  and socially.
Black humor is  a category that incorporates the  "theater of the
absurd" (Lundquist 19). That entails not only the bleak or absurd
situations in  life, but how  one reacts to  them, and sometimes,
the best way is to just laugh. No one knows this better than Kurt
Vonnegut. He has had a life filled with absurdity and bleak days,
but as Bokonon professes, "Live by  the foma that makes you brave
and  kind and  healthy and  happy" Foma,  Vonnegut tells  us, are
soothing lies (Bryan 4073).
