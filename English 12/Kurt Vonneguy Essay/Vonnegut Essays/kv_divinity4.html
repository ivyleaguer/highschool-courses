<b><u>Hero vs. Villain</u></b>
    We  are used  to books  and stories  having hero  and villain
character. When reading Vonnegut these  two poles are not easy to
identify.  You  could  even  say  that  the  stories have no hero
characters   and  no   villain  characters.   Ranly  notes  this:
"Vonnegut's  father  once  complained  that  his  stories  had no
villains.  Not  even  the  great  book  about the fire-bombing of
Dresden could uncover a villain. But then, Vonnegut has no heroes
either."  Maureen Howard  comes with  a definition  of a Vonnegut
hero: "a vaguely dissatisfied dupe in a flabby society" (Howard).
If a main character can be automatically considered to be a hero,
then her definition is correct. Most 'heroes' in Vonnegut's books
fit this description. However, I  doubt that such a character can
be called a hero. Peter J. Reed  seems to find the reason for the
lack of these characters:

              The  lack  of  real  villains  and  heroes seems an
         almost inevitable consequence of the vision of the world
         Vonnegut  creates.  It  is   hard  to  conceive  of  men
         achieving true  heroic or villainous stature  in a world
         where they are so nearly  pawns, so little in control of
         their  destinies and  where their  actions are  so often
         subject  to  chance  or  merely  'the  way the moment is
         structured.' There exists no  place for 'tragic flaw' in
         such a world. (Reed)

If  it  is  not  possible  to  find  a  hero  or  a villain in an
individual human being, let's again  move one step higher and get
back  to  considering  Humanity   and  Divinity  to  be  literary
characters.

<b>The Villain</b>
    I will attempt to identify  the villain character first. This
essay has shown that Vonnegut's Humanity is a horrible character.
People  treat  each  other  terribly,  they  are destroying their
beautiful planet etc. This could mean that Humanity as a whole is
the villain  in Vonnegut's books. However,  it is not so.  As has
been shown, Humanity cannot be  held responsible for its actions.
It is a slave to 'enormous  forces' (SH5:164). It is a subject to
forces it cannot control, forces it must obey. If it is true that
Humanity's  actions  are  far  beyond  its  control, it cannot be
considered to be the villain, no  matter how bad the actions are.
Therefore we have to look for  a character who is the slaver, the
master, the one who makes people  behave as they do. Divinity has
been identified to  be this kind of character.  In <i>Gal pagos</i>, the
oversize human  brain is identified  as the only  real villain of
the  book (GAL:270).  We may,  analogically, induce  that the Big
Brain of Humanity, that is Divinity,  is the only real villain of
Vonnegut's books.

<b>The Hero</b>
    Since Divinity is the villain, the post for a hero rightfully
belongs to  Humanity. However, how can  a 'listless plaything' be
a hero?  How can  a puppet  be  a  hero? Since  it is  thoroughly
controlled by the  villain, how can it be  labeled as 'the hero'?
It would work if 'hero' was  simply someone who is badly treated.
If  people  are  machines  or  robots,  as Vonnegut implies, they
cannot be considered to be the heroes. Hero is mostly someone who
defeats the  villain, who wins  in the end.  Does Humanity defeat
Divinity? Does it win? The answer is: Yes.
    Humanity does  not conquer Divinity physically.  It cannot do
it. It is  not capable of being set free  from the bonds Divinity
set  on it.  However, Vonnegut's  Humanity does  manage to outwit
Divinity. Even though it is physically  unable to be set free, it
manages  to be  liberate itself.  When I  dealt with people being
machines, one aspect did not really fit and it is crucial in this
moment:  human imagination.  It is  something that  is not  under
Divinity's control. It is something people are free to use at any
time,  at  times  when  they  are  otherwise  controlled  by  the
'enormous forces'. Bryant points out that Vonnegut's Humanity "is
a complex  combination of  nobility and  meanness, knowledge  and
ignorance, grandeur  and ignomity." (Bryant)  It is a  complex of
good and  bad qualities. The  bad qualities (meanness,  ignorance
and  ignomity)  can  be  ascribed  to  Divinity, because Humanity
cannot be blamed for them. It is not able to suppress them. If we
scratch  the bad  qualities (which  are mostly  in majority), the
good ones will remain.  Benjamin DeMott complains that Vonnegut's
Humanity "serves evil too openly  and good too secretly" (DeMott)
and  is  right  in  saying  so.  The  outside  of  a  Humanity is
controlled by  Divinity, the villain,  therefore Humanity appears
to be evil.  What happens 'inside' Humanity is  what's beyond the
villains power.  That's what makes Humanity  a good character. It
does  serve good  above all  things. Evil  things are  beyond its
control.
    The novel <i>Bluebeard</i> emphasizes  the difference between 'meat'
and  'soul'.  "My  soul  knows  my  meat  is  doing  bad things,"
(BLU:246). Soul is good. Meat  is evil. Kilgore Trout also agrees
with this: "Our  awareness is all that is  alive and maybe sacred
in  any  of  us.  Everything  else  about  us  is dead machinery"
(BOC:221).  Vonnegut,  indeed  manages   to  make  the  awareness
a sacred component  of a human  being. If people  did not possess
it, they would really be simple machines or puppets.
    Most of Vonnegut's novels also deal with the meaning of life,
seeking  its  purpose.  Ranly  says  that  "Vonnegut employs only
a scientific, mechanistic  meaning for purpose and  fails to find
a reasonable purpose  in either the universe  or in man." (Ranly)
Humans, therefore find  a meaning in themselves. If  they seem to
have  been  created  for  some  pathetic  reason, they can surely
invent  a purpose  inside them.  The main  character of <i>Sirens of
Titan</i> discovers this kind of answer  at the end of the novel: "It
took us  that long to  realize that a  purpose of human  life, no
matter who is controlling it, is  to love whoever is around to be
loved."  (TIT:220) Samuels  notices  this  as well:  "life passes
human understanding  but not our powers  of enjoyment" (Samuels).
It is this alternative that can be found in the heart of Humanity
that  is the  means by   which it  outwits Divinity.  If Divinity
"wants  to  write  about  somebody  who  suffers  all  the  time"
(BOC:241 ), Humanity's only way of winning is not to suffer.
    This  chapter has  shown that  there are  no real villains or
heroes in  Vonnegut's books. These  characters can be  found only
when  Humanity  and  Divinity   are  considered  to  be  literary
characters. Humanity  was proved not  to be the  villain, despite
all  the  vile  things  it  does.  It  is  led into doing them by
Divinity  and  that  is  why  Divinity  is the villain. Humanity,
however, could not  be considered to be the hero  if there was no
additional  aspect of  its character  to being  the puppet.  This
aspect has  been found in Humanity's  awareness, its imagination,
the capability of discovering its own answers. This becomes a way
for  outwitting Divinity,  a way  of winning  over it. Therefore,
Humanity can be considered to be the hero.
