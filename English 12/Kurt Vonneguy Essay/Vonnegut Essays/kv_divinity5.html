<b><u>A Parable to Vonnegut's Life</u></b>
    Vonnegut was born  into an evil world. We  all have been born
into it. However, Vonnegut went through the hell of World War II,
eye-witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden  at the end of the war.
He saw  so many people who  were killed in vain,  innocent people
burned  alive in  the fire-storm.  This has  obviously left scars
- not physical scars. He saw so  much unfairness in the world and
he tried to find where the fault was.
    He found  out how stupid people  are, how vile they  are, how
cruel they are.  However, he seems not to  be satisfied with this
discovery. He does not want people  to be the evil ones. He feels
the need to love people, but  if people are not worth loving, who
is? Nobody. Vonnegut keeps digging into the nature of human being
in  hope of  discovering that  they are  actually good.  His book
<i>Gal pagos</i> has  this introductory quotation  from Anne Frank:  "In
spite of  everything, I still  believe people are  really good at
heart," and Vonnegut  seems to really believe it.  However, if we
want something evil to be good, we have to remove the bad things.
In order to lift up the  minority of good things, we must somehow
erase the majority of bad things. Vonnegut manages to do this. He
invents  an  entity  onto  whose  back  he  puts  all  the blame:
Divinity. Thus, people  are made clean and pure,  worthy of love.
John R. May says  that "we may not be able to  undo the harm that
has been done, but we can certainly love, simply because they are
people, those  who have been  made useless by  our past stupidity
and greed, our previous crimes against our brothers. " (May)
    Vonnegut  managed to  find a  way of  adaptation to the chaos
this  world offered  him. "It  is hard  to adapt  to chaos," says
Vonnegut, "but  it can be done.  I am a living  proof of that: It
can  be done."  (BOC:210)  Vonnegut  re-invented himself.  If the
world could not confirm a reasonable purpose, he invented one.
    He also seems to try to show  that he is a better person than
Divinity.  In  <i>Breakfast  of  Champions</i>  he  decides  to free his
literary slaves.  "No more puppet  shows" he cries.  (BOC:5) "Mr.
Trout,  I love  you," says  Vonnegut to  his literary  slave when
liberating him from his bond. "I have broken your mind to pieces.
I want to make it whole. I want you to feel a wholeness and inner
harmony  such  as  I  have  never  allowed  you  to feel before."
(BOC:293).  If Vonnegut  can do  it, probably  Divinity can learn
from him.  It can shout "Arise,  you are free, you  are free," as
well.  (BOC:294)  If  it  does  not,  it  changes  nothing, since
Vonnegut is free. He has found freedom in himself.

<b>Vonnegut and God in court</b>
    Vonnegut,   as   he   himself   says,   is   a   sceptic  and
a Free-thinker. He says he does  not believe in God Almighty, yet
God plays the  major part in his books.  Vonnegut's work seems to
become  a great  courtoom, with  Vonnegut the  Judge and  God the
defendant. The events and human beings in the book are witnesses.
Vonnegut apart from being the Judge  is also the Approver. If God
manages to  prove that He  is not guilty,  that He is  not guilty
even  though  He  allows  wars,  poverty,  sicknesses, murders of
innocent people etc, He may be acquitted. (adapted from Lewis)
    However,  Vonnegut still  may find  out that  he has  got the
'wrong guy'. While  admitting the existence of God  in his books,
he  never  mentions  the  devil.  Similarly  to  Christian faith,
'Christian  God' and  Christians,  Vonnegut  hates sin  and loves
people. He also ascribes the origin ofsin to a higher entity. The
only real  difference is that  for Christians this  entity is the
devil and for Vonnegut it  is 'God'. However, basically these two
beings,  the devil  as seen  by Christians  and 'God'  as seen by
Vonnegut,  are  in  fact  the  same  entity:  the  evil one. What
Vonnegut fails  to see is  the God as  seen by Christians.  Well,
there is still hope that, as the trial goes on, the Judge and the
Jury  (the  readers)  will  find  out  that  the defendant is not
guilty.
