<b><u>CHAPTER IV: Vonnegut as the Hero</u></b>

      This chapter  will attempt to  explain the reason  why
Vonnegut writes  as he does and  investigate his interest in
his  writing.  It  will  explore  the  relationship  between
Vonnegut's person and his fiction.

<b>Fiction and Autobiography merged</b>
      Bergoettz calls  some of Vonnegut's  novels "personal"
(Bergoettz)  and this  chapter will  show in  which ways his
novels (and  all writing) are  personal and what  it is that
Vonnegut  is  actually  doing   through  writing  books  and
stories.
      There are several features  in Vonnegut's writing that
enable the  reader to draw  links between fact  and fiction,
especially   those   between   Vonnegut   himself   and  his
characters.

<b>Kilgore Trout - Vonnegut in the Mirror</b>
      Kilgore   Trout  is   a  character   that  appears  in
Vonnegut's  books  more  frequently  than  any  other. While
playing  a minor  part in,  for example,  <i>God Bless You, Mr.
Rosewater</i>  or  <i>Galapagos</i>,  being  only  mentioned in several
others, such as  <i>Jailbird</i> or <i>Hocus Pocus</i>, he  appears as the
major character  in two other books:  <i>Breakfast of Champions</i>
and <i>Timequake</i>.  He is a writer,  like Kurt Vonnegut. Trout's
person, however,  is rather obscure. There  are many details
about  his life  mentioned throughout  these books,  but the
bits and pieces of information often contradict one another.
For  example, <i>Breakfast  of Champions</i>  says that  he died in
1983.  In  <i>Timequake</i>,  he  is  still  alive  in 2001 and, as
Vonnegut  says, dies  that year.  (TQK:xiii). While  in some
novels,  he   is  an  unknown  writer,   in  others,  he  is
a distinguished  writer  and  scientist  who  has  even been
awarded  the  Nobel  Prize  (BOC:16,25).  However,  a  short
biography can be put together from the pieces of information
available, with  the omission of  the contradicti ng  parts,
however.
      He was  born in a  family of ornithologists  and spent
his  childhood in  Bermuda. It  was depressing  (BOC:31). He
started  writing  when  he  was  fourteen  years old, but no
distinguished publisher would publish  his stories or books.
His prose  was usually published  in trash and  pornographic
magazines only  (e.g. The Black  Garterbelt), fulfilling the
sole  function  of  a  filler  between  obscene pictures and
photos.  The  text  had  nothing  to  do  with the pictures,
though.  His paperback  novels,  when  they managed  to find
a publisher,   were   failures   and   usually   served   as
a shop-window  dressing  only.  His  readership  was  really
small; people who bought the pornographic magazines were not
interested in the text anyway and not many people bought the
paperbacks, either. He had only a  few fans. One of the most
devoted  ones  was  definitely  Eliot  Rosewater (SH5, ROS).
Another "avid fan" (SH5:168) is  Billy Pilgrim, who has read
"dozens  of  books"  by  Trout.  (SH5:166)  Despite  the low
popularity, he was very  fruitful, having written 117 novels
and about 2000  short stories (by the time  of the action of
<i>Breakfast of Champions</i>).
      His family life was sad. His numerous mariages did not
work out and  his son, Leon, ran away from  home when he was
sixteen. He  lived alone in his  rented apartment in Illium.
Another known place of residence  was an aparment in Cohoes,
NY, where he lived with his parakeet, Cyclone Bill, only. In
order to get  money (which he ususally did  not get from his
writing  career)  he  did  various  jobs.  He  worked as "an
installer  of   aluminous  combination  storm   windows  and
screens." (BOC:20), he was "a stock clerk in a trading stamp
redemption center" (ROS:19). In <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, his job
was  "a circulation  man for  the Illium  Gazette" where  he
"managed newspaper delivery boys,  bullied and flattered and
cheated  little  kids"  (SH5:166).  Giving  freedom  to  his
parakeet in 1975 and having  learned of his son's death, "he
becomes a vagabond" (TQK). However,  at the end of his life,
the odds  seem to work for  him. He even receives  the nobel
prize.  (BOC:25)  and  even  his  jokes  start  to  be taken
seriously. (BOC:19)
      There  are   many  reasons  why  a   reader  can  draw
a conclusion that  Vonnegut and Trout  have a lot  in common
and that, probably, when talking about Trout, Vonnegut talks
about himself. Various critics have come to this conclusion,
even before  Vonnegut admitted himself  that Trout has  been
his "alter ego" (TQK:xiii). Lundquist, for example, has used
this  term, alter  ego, for  Kilgore Trout  as early as 1977
(Lundquist:41).
      The things that are similar between Trout and Vonnegut
are  many. One  thing is  their writing.  Their stories,  or
novels, often  have the same themes  or the same characters.
To mention several examples, one  story that is very similar
is  Trout's novel  2BR0TB (ROS:19-21)  and Vonnegut's  short
story "Welcome to the Monkey House". In both, the reader can
find the  idea of Ethical Suicide  Parlors, where people can
have themselves killed legally  and humanely. The two places
are  described almost  identically. Another  thing Trout and
Vonnegut  have  in  common  is  the  planet Tralfamadore and
aliens called Tralfamadorians. It  is the planet where Billy
Pilgrim  (SH5) is  taken to  when kidnapped  by UFO's.  This
planet  appears  also  in  <i>Sirens  of  Titan</i>.  It appears in
several of  Trout's stories, for  example "Protocols of  the
Elders of  Tralfamadore" (HOC). Even though  the accounts of
Tralfamadore  and  Tralfamadorians  differ  slightly both in
Trout's stories  and in Vonnegut's  books, it is  an element
the two writers have in common.
      Many  of  the  novels  of  Kilgore  Trout have similar
themes  as Vonnegut's  and attack  the same  things over and
over again,  such as automation, free  will, religion, human
stupidity, greed and obsession  with money, sexual lust etc.
Many of Trout's stories  appear throughout Vonnegut's books,
usually stripped  so that the  readers can read  the plot of
the story condensed into  one paragraph. One, and definitely
not only, example can be the story about a money tree:

              Trout, incidentally, had  written a book about
         a money  tree.  It  had  twenty  dollar  bills  for
         leaves.  Its  flowers  were  government  bonds. Its
         fruit was  diamonds. It attracted  human beings who
         killed each  other around the  roots and made  very
         good fertilizer. (SH5:167)

      Another  parallel between  Trout and  Vonnegut can  be
seen in the publishers of their stories and books. Vonnegut,
too, was  first published in various  magazines. "Welcome to
the Monkey House", for  example, appeared in Playboy. Others
include   The   Atlantic    Monthly,   Collier's   Magazine,
Cosmopolitan, Fantasy  and Science Fiction  Magazine, Ladies
Home  Journal, The  New York  Times, Saturday  Evening Post,
Venture etc. His first books appeared in paperback only.
      In <i>God  Bless You, Mr. Rosewater</i>,  the reader can find
the  description  of  Trout's  favorite  formula for writing
stories:

         Trout's   favorite   formula    was   to   describe
         a perfectly  hideous society,  not unlike  his own,
         and then, toward the end,  to suggest ways in which
         it could be improved. (ROS:20)

This is the  very formula that Vonnegut himself  is using in
his fiction, as has already been described.
      In the  biography of these two  people, there are also
several suprising coincidences.  For example, Vonnegut, just
like  Trout, probably  started writing  at an  early age. In
1936,  Vonnegut,  when  at  High  School,  was  one  of  the
publishers  of  a  school  magazine,  Shortridge  Daily Echo
(Zelenka:159). He was fourteen when he started attending the
school, just as Trout was  fourteen when he started writing.
His  first short  story, "Report  on the  Barnhouse Effect",
however, was published another fourteen years  later, at the
age of  twenty-eight. Some places  are also common  both for
Trout and Vonnegut: especially Cape Cod.
      Trout  can  really  be  seen  as  Vonnegut's fictional
counterpart,  a  parody  of  Vonnegut  or  Vonnegut's mirror
image. Beorgettz notes that  Trout is "also a representation
of what  Vonnegut himself might  become." (Beorgettz:chapter
1) This  is one of the  reasons why the reader  can consider
Vonnegut's fiction to be more autobiography than fiction.

<b>Billy Pilgrim and other autobiographical characters</b>
      Kilgore Trout is not  the only literary character that
seems to carry Vonnegut's image.  In his writing, the reader
can   find   more   characters    that   could   be   called
autobiographical characters.
      Billy  Pilgrim is  probably  the  most obvious  of the
characters  that  reflects  Vonnegut  himself. Billy Pilgrim
re-lives the  hell of the fire-storming  of Dresden in 1945,
an event  that probably had the  greatest impact on Vonnegut
and his writing. Apart from  the identical events that Billy
and  Vonnegut experience  (the war,  being prisoners-of-war,
work in  Dresden and the  actual bombing), Vonnegut  prompts
two  other hints  that leave  no doubt  that Vonnegut equals
Billy Pilgrim: "That was I. That was me. That was the author
of this book," (SH5:125, 148) Vonnegut writes.
      Another  of   Vonnegut's  characters  that   could  be
connected with  the writer himself  by the mark  "equals" is
Wilbur Daffodil-11 Swain in <i>Slapstick</i>. Without the fact that
Vonnegut  said himself  in  the  prologue that  <i>Slapstick</i> is
rather an autobiography, the readers would hardly be able to
see  the autobiographical  elements themselves.  Having read
this before the novel starts makes them constantly wonder at
the things  depicted in the story.  Vonnegut says this about
the  novel: "It  depicts myself  and my  beautiful sister as
monsters."  (SLP:24)  His  sister,  Alice, was embarassingly
tall, and  died of cancer  (Nicol:1302) and even  though the
setting is  all fictional, it  is about Alice  and Kurt. The
book   is  about   "what  life   feels  like   to  Vonnegut"
(Nicol:1302).  It  is  also   an  experiment  with  old  age
(SLP:25) which Vonnegut started  to enter (he was fifty-four
when <i>Slapstick</i> was published.)
      Kilgore  Trout  "co-stars"  in  <i>Breakfast of Champions</i>
with Dwayne  Hoover. The latter is  also much like Vonnegut.
Hoover has a dog, Sparky, and loves to get down on the floor
and roll  around with him  and speak to  him (BOC:17-18). In
the prologue  to <i>Slapstick</i>, Vonnegut  says that this  is his
own love, too:

         I used  to spend  a lot  of time  rolling around on
         rugs with uncritically affectionate dogs we had.
              And I still do a  lot of that. The dogs become
         tired and confused and embarassed long before I do.
         I could go on forever. (SLP:12)

This  is  one  connecting  thing  that  connects Hoover with
Vonnegut. Another of the  connecting things is Dwayne's job:
a car  salesman.  Vonnegut  himself  was  a  Saab  dealer in
1954-56 (Zelenka:160).
      David  Potter  in  "Deer  in  the  Works" also reminds
a reader  of  Kurt  Vonnegut.  The  story  probably is about
Vonnegut.  Potter comes  to the  Illium Works  to apply  for
a job  as  a  writer  in  advertising  and  sales  promotion
(WTM:207). He  also owns a weekly  paper in Dorset. Vonnegut
himself  was  working  as  a  publicist  in General Electric
Company  in Schenectady,  N.Y. Feeling  trapped, like Potter
and the deer, he left in  1951 and became a full-time writer
(Zelenka:160).
      Rudy Watz is also a reflection of Vonnegut, as he says
in the preface of <i>Deadeye Dick</i> (DED:xiii)

         The neutered  pharmacist who tells  the tale is  my
         declining  sexuality.  The  crime  he  commited  in
         childhood  is  all  the  bad  things  I  have done.
         (DED:xiii)

      Not  only from  these,  but  from other  characters of
Vonnegut's  can  the  reader  conclude  that  Vonnegut often
writes  about himself.  It is  also the  usual first  person
narrative Vonnegut  mostly uses. <i>Slapstick</i>,  for example, is
an autobiography of Wilbur Swain, therefore written in first
person. In <i>Hocus Pocus</i>, Eugene  Debs Hartke writes about his
life on bits of paper, and  again, there is the first person
narrative. <i>Bluebeard</i> is another  autobiography, this time of
Rabo Karabekian. <i>Jailbird</i> is  another. <i>Palm Sunday</i> and Fates
Worse  than  Death  have  the  subtitle "An Autobiographical
Collage", yet  the style and  the narrative does  not differ
much  from  Vonnegut's  other  novels  that  could  be named
"fiction",  <i>Timequake</i>, for  example. The  narrative helps to
persuade the  reader that Vonnegut,  by talking about  other
people, talks about himself. That is why it appears to be so
attractive  and natural  for  Vonnegut  to choose  the first
person narrative  in majority of  his books, especially  the
later ones.
      Further,  the personal  prefaces and  prologues to his
books usually contain the same  devices as the actual novel.
For example, in the prologue to <i>Slapstick</i>, Vonnegut uses the
same "senile  hiccup 'hi ho'"  just as throughout  the whole
book      (SLP:12,16,17,19,25).      Chapter      one     of
<i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, being an introduction, uses for example
the recurrent phrase "So it goes" (SH5:21). The frequency of
and-so-on's  and  et-cetera's   and  other  similar  phrases
Vonnegut  uses  in  his  fiction  is  also  something  th at
connects  the actual  story with  the personal  note in  the
beginning.

<b>Autobiographical Places</b>
      Vonnegut writes  about many places,  but many of  them
are   actual  places,   where  Vonnegut   lived  or  worked.
Indianapolis can  be one of them.  Many events of Vonnegut's
writing are set in Indiana,  or the capital itself. Cape Cod
appears in  many books, too (CAT,  ROS, SH5 etc.) and  it is
actually where Vonnegut has lived  as well (TQK:xi). To name
a few  more, Schenectady  and New  York appear  in his books
frequently, too, and these two  places are also where he has
lived.

<b>Vonnegut appearing in his books</b>
      Vonnegut himself  has appeared as  a character in  his
books or, if not as a  character, he mentions himself in the
narrative.  This happens  especially in  his later  fiction,
where the style of writing requires it. The way Vonnegut has
been  writing  recently,  appears  to  be  a  kind of taking
inventory  of  things  in  his  head.  The  best  example is
probably  the novel  <i>Timequake</i>: Vonnegut  wrote one  version
first but it  "stunk" (TQK:xii) so he rewrote  it. It is now
a "stew  made  from  [Timequake-1's]  best  parts mixed with
thoughts and experiences during the past seven months or so"
(TQK:xii). His autobiographical  "collages", <i>Palm Sunday</i> and
Fates Worse  than Death, are  written in a  similar way. One
book of his even uses him as a literary character: Breakfast
of Champions.
      The  fact that  Vonnegut  himself  appears in  his own
books draws still a closer  link between Vonnegut's life and
his fiction. At times he seems to cease to use parallels and
analogies and writes it in  a straightforward way that he is
writing not  about fictional things,  but about things  that
are real,  things that Vonnegut  can see in  the world about
himself.


<u><b>Vonnegut's "amber"</b></u>

      Having  demonstrated the  way characters  in his books
are "stuck in amber" and defined what the "amber" is in some
works  in  particular,  it  can  now  be  shown what kind of
"amber" Vonnegut finds himself.
      The  key  novel   remains  <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>,  which
depicts  the author's  experience in  World War  Two and the
destruction  of  Dresden.  Though   there  were  many  other
difficult events in Vonnegut's  life, the events around 13th
February 1945 are certainly most influential of his writing.
Though Dresden is  mentioned only in a few  books (e.g. SH5,
ROS), the issue of war recurs very frequently in most of his
books, be it World War Two,  the war in Vietnam or any other
wars or battles, both real and  fiction al. It appears to be
very difficult for Vonnegut to escape from the memories, the
experiences he gained as a  soldier, from the vision that he
saw,  vision  of  the  dead  people,  cruel people, sadistic
people, innocent people etc. in the war.
      It is  not only the death  he saw during the  war that
haunts  him. It  is generally  the unfairness  of affairs on
this  planet. A  great shock  for him  was the  death of his
sister  Alice and  her  husband,  which left  their children
orphans.  He returns  to this  events several  times in  his
writing, first in <i>Slapstick</i>, and several later books as well
(e.g. <i>Palm Sunday</i>).
      Weekly Guardian  once asked Vonnegut what  his idea of
perfect  happiness  was.  His   answer  was:  "Imaging  that
something somewhere  wants us to  like it here."  (Quoted in
Huber:/fwtd.html)  This  answer  corresponds  with what this
essay   has   shown   about   Vonnegut's   Divinity:  it  is
indifferent, it  makes people suffer.  Divinity, as Vonnegut
describes  it, certainly  does not  want people  to "like it
here". This is also a  fact which Vonnegut cannot escape and
change anything about.

<u><b>Vonnegut's ways out</b></u>
      Vonegut  has found  himself in  an "amber"  but he has
also  decided not  to stay  there. It  is apparent  from his
writing  that he  has found  a way  out for  himself. It  is
possible  to  watch  the  development,  Vonnegut's progress,
throughout his  books. With the  help of the  ways that have
been already identified in his books, the following sections
will explore and identify Vonnegut's personal ways out.

<b>Re-invention</b>
      The most common way out  of amber in Vonnegut's novels
and stories  was re-intervention. The  "amber" which trapped
Vonnegut has surely been highly uncomfortable, causing a lot
of suffering and painful  memories. Since Vonnegut could not
control  these circumstances  of  his  life, could  not take
anything  back, could  not revive  dead people  and undo the
harm, he needed  to find a different way  out. Therefore, in
the same way as characters  in his books, Vonnegut needed to
re-invent  the universe,  the worl  d, his  life, so that he
could stay  alive and keep his  sanity. It can be  told from
his writing, that he has succeeded in the re-invention.

<b>Re-invention through literature</b>
      One of Vonnegut's tools of re-invention is literature.
It seems that the most important way that Vonnegut has found
for escaping the  amber is his writing, his  fiction as well
as non-fiction.  The position of  an author of  books offers
him several vantage points.

<b>Billy Pilgrim effect</b>
      The first of the vantage points is what will be called
"Billy     Pilgrim     Effect".     Billy     Pilgrim,    in
<i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>,  tends  to  get  "unstuck  in time". It
means that he travels in  time back or forth, living through
various  periods  of  his  life.This  also  enables him, for
example,  to  see  the  war  motion  picture backwards. This
time-travelling  also  helps  him  accept the Tralfamadorian
attitude  towards  life,  makes   it  possible  for  him  to
concentrate on  good moments and forget  about the bad ones.
Similar tool is used in  some other novels, too. Leon Trout,
for  example, narrates  the story  of <i>Galapagos</i>  in the same
almost random way, in this case from the position of a ghost
in a far future. Similar effect is reached e.g. in <i>Timequake</i>
through  Vonnegut's  first  person  narrative. <i>Timequake</i> has
been  called  a  "stew"  (TQK:xii),  being  compiled  of  an
original book and Vonnegut's experiences.
      Literature  in   general  offers  Vonnegut   the  same
viewpoint  of Leon  Trout or  Billy Pilgrim,  or Eugene Debs
Hartke  etc.  He  can  write   whatever  he  wants,  he  can
concentrate  on some  things while  ignore others.  "I could
sort  out good  ideas  from  heaps of  balderdash," (SLP:89)
Vonnegut  says   about  Wilbur  Swain,   his  own  fictional
counterpart  in  <i>Slapstick</i>  and  it  seems  to  be  true for
Vonnegut. He can look at life  the same way Billy Pilgrim at
the  stretch  of  the  Rocky  Mountains (SH5:61). Literature
enables  him to  "see a  war movie  backwards" just as Billy
Pilgrim.

<b>Humor</b>
      Humor is  also a very  often used tool  Vonnegut uses.
Vonnegut's   books  truly   are  often   very  humorous  and
entertaining.  The   reader  may  sometimes   consider  this
inappropriate,  because  Vonnegut  often  uses  his  joke in
places where people would not  expect them, for example when
burning the rotting dead bodies after the bombing of Dresden
or mourning  his sister's death.  When Alice died,  he wrote
the novel <i>Slapstick</i> about her and himself, depicting the two
siblings as monsters. Leaving aside if it is ap propriate or
not, Vonnegut  seems to use  humor to help  him reach deeper
into the subject  about which he is writing,  and maybe even
help  him  come  to  terms   with  all  the  things  he  has
experienced. Scholes notes that

         the humor in Vonnegut's  fiction is what enables us
         to  contemplate   the  horror  that   he  finds  in
         contemporary  existence. It  does not  disguise the
         awful things  perceived; it merely  strengthens and
         comforts us  to the point where  such perception is
         bearable. (Scholes:23)

It  took Vonnegut  more than  twenty years  to write  a book
about Dresden. <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>  was finally published in
1969,  many years  after his   return from  the war.  In his
introduction to  the novel, Vonnegut  explains how difficult
it was for him to write the book:

              I  would  hate  to  tell  you  what this lousy
         little book cost me in  money and anxiety and time.
         When  I   got  home  from  the   Second  World  War
         twenty-three years ago, I  thought it would be easy
         for me  to write about the  destruction of Dresden,
         since  all I  would have  to do  would be to report
         what I had seen...
              But not many words  about Dresden came from my
         mind  then--not  enough  of  them  to  make a book,
         anyway.  And  not  many  words  come now, either...
         (SH5:2)

      It  seems  to  have  taken  him  twenty-three years to
re-invent the whole affair and  write a book about it, using
humor which  helps him approach the  matter and describe the
things he had gone through.
      All Vonnegut's  books use humor  and most of  them for
the same  purpose, even though they  seldom speak about such
tragic reality as  Dresden. Yet all the themes  of his books
are serious and humor makes  it easier both for Vonnegut and
the reader to cope with  it. "Comedy looks into depths which
tragedy dares not acknowledge"  (Scholes:23) and that is the
reason for the unusual style of his books.

<b>Sci-fi</b>
      Another tool Vonnegut often uses  as a means of escape
is science-fiction. Majority of  his stories can be labelled
"sci-fi" as  well as his early  novels, Player Piano, <i>Sirens
of Titan</i> and <i>Cat's Cradle</i>.  The other works by Vonnegut tend
to  have some  sci-fi features  as well,  such as <i>Timequake</i>,
<i>Slapstick</i>  or  <i>Galapagos</i>.  In  many  of  them  he  uses  his
fictional  counterpart, Kilgore  Trout, to  incorporate some
sci-fi ideas  into his books. Most  surprisingly, though, he
uses some  science-fiction elements eve n  in his book about
Dresden, <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>.  It seems absurd  that in such
a serious   book    Vonnegut   would   use    his   favorite
Tralfamadorians.
      Science-fiction  seems  to  have  a  similar  role  in
Vonnegut's  writing  as  humor.   It  helps  him  touch  the
essential  things which  he really  wants to  talk about. It
seems that Vonnegut wraps an issue in a science-fiction coat
and thus  brings it to absurdity.  Then, while talking about
absurd things, he talks about  the essential things as well.
"The truth of Vonnegut's  vision requires its fiction," says
Scholes    about    Vonnegut's    usage    of    sci-fi   in
<i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>.  "Art, as  Picasso has  said, is  a lie
that makes us realize the truth. Kurt Vonnegut Jr. is a true
artist." (Scholes:23) Vonnegut himself says that

         science-fiction was the best way how to write about
         opinions  on various  things: General  Electric and
         the loss of human dignity, the loss of trust in the
         government, the loss of belief  in god, the loss of
         belief  in  the  innocence  of  science  and so on.
         (Vonnegut, quoted in Zelenka:111, transl.)

      Sci-fi,  similarly  as  humor,  helps Vonnegut achieve
a different  perspective  of  history   and  its  cruel  and
unpleasant  facts.  It  helps  him  re-invent  the world and
change it for better.

<b>Bargaining in good faith</b>
      In <i>Slapstick</i>  Vonnegut mentions Laurel  and Hardy, two
comedians  of  his  time  and  as  he  says  in  the  book's
dedication,  "angels" (SLP:7).  What he  found so intriguing
about the two is that "they  never failed to bargain in good
faith  with their  destinies"  (SLP:11)  and that  "they did
their  best   with  every  test"  (SLP:11).   This  is  what
Vonnegut's life may seem to be -- a big test. (Zelenka:15)
      What Laurel  and Hardy did on  the screen, Vonnegut is
doing on paper: doing his best to pass the test his life has
given  him and  bargaining in  good faith  with destiny.  In
Breakfast of  Champions Vonnegut said  that God was  perhaps
trying to find how much human beings could stand before they
broke (BOC:166).  Vonnegut refuses to break  even though his
mind and  memory are haunted by  the horrors of war,  and is
trying to  stand his ground  despite Divinity's "destructive
testing".

<b>People versus God Almighty</b>
      Vonnegut  does  not  stay  at  just  passive  enduring
Divinity's  tests.  He  goes  on  and  apparently challenges
Divinity.  Divinity is  in Vonnegut's  eyes a  failure. Life
under this God is unfair and Vonnegut, refusing to submit to
such  an  authority,  seems  to  be  calling  upon  a higher
authority. C.S. Lewis has written an essay "God in the Dock"
where he  describes a common relationship  of people to God:
that God is in the dock  and has to defend himself and prove
that he  really is the God  Almighty that the <i>Bible</i>  says He
is.  Vonnegut  seems  to  be  doing  the  same, creating the
biggest case  in history: people  (or Humanity) vs.  God (or
Divinity).
      The  courtroom  scene  is  created  through Vonnegut's
writing, through  works of both fiction  and non-fiction. In
this trial,  God is the defendant  and Vonnegut presents the
pieces  of evidence  against Him  one by  one, the wars, the
state of human beings,  the chaotic universe, the over-sized
brains, heredity  and so on. They  are Divinity's fault. The
human  beings  and  the   events  of  Vonnegut's  books  are
witnesses,  Vonnegut himself  being the  state's evidence or
approver.  If God  managed to  prove that  He is not guilty,
that He is  not guilty even though He  allows wars, poverty,
sicknesses,  murders of  innocent  people  etc, He  might be
acquitted.  (adapted  from  Lewis)  However,  the  pieces of
evidence  speaking  against  Divinity  are  so numerous, the
testimonies so  convincing. The jury,  the readers, seem  to
have no other choice than to say "guilty".
      The trial  with God or  the argument with  and against
God may be another purpose  of his writing, of literature in
his  hands. Vonnegut,  seeing no  other way  of getting even
with Divinity, uses literature to  help him. Here he is free
to  speak   against  Divinity,  which  is   in  his  opinion
responsible for  all the bad  things. It is  also a kind  of
re-invention.

<b>New Religion</b>
      Apparently having won his literary trial, Vonnegut has
created  a new  religion. Having  condemned seeking  help in
Divinity altogether, he tells  people to turn to themselves.
Vonnegut  himself does  this through  literature which helps
him find  his individual answers  to paradoxical truths  and
answers  (Reed:94).  He  also  becomes  a  creator,  a  god,
similarly as in his novel <i>Breakfast of Champions</i>, the master
of puppets, the one who has  the power to create and destroy
as he  will. By standing  in this posit  ion, he appears  to
give hints at  how it should be done,  especially at the end
of  Breakfast  of  Champions,  when  he  decides to give his
slaves freedom.

<b>Re-invention through love</b>
      Vonnegut was born  into an evil world. He  saw so many
people who were killed in vain, innocent people burned alive
in  the  fire-storm.  This  has  obviously  left scars - not
physical scars. He  saw so much unfairness in  the world and
he  tried to  find where  the fault  was. He  found out  how
stupid people  are, how vile  they are, how  cruel they are.
However, he  seems not to be  satisfied with this discovery.
He does  not want people to  be the evil ones.  He feels the
need to love people. Vonnegut may be asking the question who
is  worth loving  if not   people. He  keeps probing  in the
nature of human beings in  hope of discovering that they are
actually  good.  His  book  <i>Galapagos</i>  has this introductory
quotation from Anne Frank: "In  spite of everything, I still
believe people are really good at heart," (GAL) and Vonnegut
seems to  really believe it. However,  if he wants something
evil to be  good, he has to remove the  bad things. In order
to lift up the minority of  the good things, he must somehow
erase the maj ority of the  bad things. He invents an entity
onto  whose  back  he  puts  all  the blame: Divinity. Thus,
people are made clean and pure, worthy of love. John R. May,
in  a  review  of  <i>God  Bless  You,  Mr.  Rosewater</i>,  quotes
Vonnegut:

         we may not  be able to undo the  harm that has been
         done,  but we  can certainly  love, simply  because
         they are  people, those who have  been made useless
         by  our  past  stupidity  and  greed,  our previous
         crimes  against our  brothers, (Vonnegut  quoted in
         May)

and  it  is  what  Vonnegut  tries  to  prove throughout his
writing and life.
      Even though Vonnegut is  an atheist and a free-thinker
and  a sceptic  (PSU:30), he  seems to  be fascinated by the
person of Jesus Christ, especially  His Sermon on the Mount.
In this sermon, Jesus teaches the people much about love for
their neighbour, even love  for their enemies (Matthew 5-7).
Vonnegut,  though calling  religion "balderdash",  says that
Christ's   Sermon  on   the  Mount   cannot  be   considered
"balderdash"  (TQK:112).  Leonard  makes  a  list of "sacred
documents" for Vonnegut, which includes Christ's sermon:

         In his last novel,  <i>Slapstick</i> (1976), Kurt Vonnegut
         told  us that  he believed  in the  Bill of Rights,
         Robert's  Rules  of  Order  and  the  principles of
         Alcoholics Anonymous. In his new novel, <i>Jailbird</i> --
         his best, in my  opinion, since <i>Mother Night</i> (1961)
         and <i>Cat's  Cradle</i> (1963) -- he  adds another sacred
         document. It is the Sermon on the Mount. (Leonard)

In spite of everything that  Vonnegut had said about God and
people, he was once invited to preach in an Episcopal Church
in New  York. The opening sentence  of his speech was  "I am
enchanted by the Sermon on the Mount." (PSU:325)

<b>Summary of Vonnegut as a hero</b>
      Vonnegut managed  to find a  way of adaptation  to the
chaos  this  world  offered  him.  "It  is  hard to adapt to
chaos," says  Vonnegut, "but it can  be done. I am  a living
proof  of   that:  It  can  be   done"  (BOC:210).  Vonnegut
re-invented  himself.   If  the  world   could  not  confirm
a reasonable purpose, he invented one.
      He  also seems  to try  to show  that he  is a  better
person than  Divinity. In Breakfast of  Champions he decides
to free his literary slaves. "No more puppet shows" he cries
(BOC:5).  "Mr.  Trout,  I  love  you,"  says Vonnegut to his
literary slave  when liberating him  from his bond.  "I have
broken your mind to pieces. I  want to make it whole. I want
you to  feel a wholeness  and inner harmony  such as I  have
never allowed you to feel before" (BOC:293). If Vonnegut can
do it, probably Divinity can learn  fro m him. It can shout:
"Arise, you are  free, you are free," as  well (BOC:294). If
it does not, it changes  nothing, since Vonnegut is free. He
has found freedom in himself.
      One  of his  invented purposes  of life  is "love  for
one's neighbor". Although this  appears in Christ's teaching
("You shall  love your neighbor as  yourself" - Mark 12,31),
Vonnegut isolates this commandment  from the other important
commandment  Jesus  gives  people,  numbering  it  first  in
importance: "You shall love the  Lord your God with all your
heart, and with  all your soul, and with  all your mind, and
with  all  your  strength"   (Mark  12,30).  Though  quoting
Christ's  words, Vonnegut  chooses only  the p  arts of  his
teaching that  speak about love for  people: it's the people
that matter  most. "We are  here to help  each other to  get
through this...  whatever it is," (Mark  Vonnegut, quoted in
TQK) seems to  be Vonegut's motto. This is  probably what he
is also doing in his  writing: helping people to get through
life, helping  people invent their purpose  of life, helping
people go through difficult situations etc.
