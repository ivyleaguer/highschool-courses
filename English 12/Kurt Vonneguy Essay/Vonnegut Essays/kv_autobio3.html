<b><u>Chapter 2 - Philosophy and Opinions</u></b>

<b><u>War</u></b>

    Above  all  else,  Kurt  Vonnegut  is  a  pacifist,  and  his
pacifistic views are the major theme of Slaughterhouse-Five. They
form a definite  undercurrent in the other three  novels that are
under study as well.
    The  tone  of  Slaughterhouse-Five  is  set  early.  Vonnegut
recounts the  friendship he and Bernard  V. O'Hare established in
Dresden in  1967 with a taxi  cab driver. That Christmas  the cab
driver sent holiday greetings saying that he hoped they would all
meet again  in a world  of peace and  freedom (1-2). Thus  is the
pacifistic dash that is Slaughterhouse-Five begun.
    Not  that Vonnegut  is racing  with blinders  on. He  quickly
follows up  the mentioning of  the cab driver  with his encounter
with Harrison  Starr, the movie-maker. When  Starr finds out that
Vonnegut is  writing an anti-war book  Starr tells him he  may as
well  write an  anti-glacier book  because glaciers  are about as
easy to stop as wars. Vonnegut agrees with him (3).
    A recurring  view of war in  Slaughterhouse-Five is that wars
are  fought  by  babies.  This  is  first discussed when Vonnegut
writes  about  going  to  visit  O'Hare  as  he  tries to collect
information and  stories for the  book he's working  on. O'Hare's
wife,  Mary, is  seething with  anger at  Vonnegut, and  he can't
figure  out  why.  She  eventually  lets  him  know.  She accuses
Vonnegut of planning to write a story that will pretend that they
who  fought World  War II  were men  instead of  babies, and that
war-loving, dirty  old glamorous men like  Frank Sinatra and John
Wayne  will  play  them  in   movies  and  make  everything  look
wonderful, so a lot more wars will be fought, because they are so
wonderful, and they'll continue to be fought by babies, just like
her and  Vonnegut's own children. Vonnegut  promises her his book
will have no part that Frank Sinatra or John Wayne could or would
play (14-5).
    Vonnegut returns to this thought  when Billy Pilgrim is being
held as a  POW by the Germans. Due to  the long train trip before
reaching a prison camp, the  soldier's faces all become hidden by
beards. After they  are left to stay with  some British POW's who
give them razors to shave with, the U.S. soldiers are revealed to
be mere  children. The British colonel  who is in charge  says to
himself, "'My God, my God  - It's the Children's Crusade'" (106).
Their youth is reinforced when  it's pointed out that, while they
are  quartered  in  Dresden,  Billy  Pilgrim  and  Werner  Gluck,
a childish German soldier  who is helping to watch  over the U.S.
POW's, have never seen naked women before (158-9).
    It  is apt  that Vonnegut  subtitles Slaughterhouse-Five  The
Children's Crusade, for that is a metaphor for all wars, for they
are hopeless  ventures fought by deluded  children (Priest 3385).
Vonnegut  points out  that the  Children's Crusade  was a  scheme
started by two  monks to delude children into  thinking that they
were going to Palestine to fight for their God. This harkens back
to  Mary O'Hare's  earlier point,  agreed with  by Vonnegut, that
we're always being told how wonderful  war is, and it also brings
up the fact that religions love wars (SF 16), because what better
method  can the  church use  to obtain  money and  power than  to
convince its members that they are fighting a holy war, a war for
their God?
    Since this  book is about  the firebombing of  Dresden, it is
short,  because  there  is   nothing  intelligent  to  say  about
massacres  (SF 19).  Vonnegut has  told his  sons (what about his
daughters?) that they are not to take part in massacres under any
circumstances,  nor are  they to  work for  companies which  make
massacre  machinery.  They  are  also   not  to  be  filled  with
satisfaction  or glee  when they   hear news  of the  massacre of
enemies, and they are to express contempt for people who think we
need massacre machinery (19).
    Vonnegut throws a satirical barb at the rules of warfare when
Billy, who has just been fired  upon, stands politely where he is
to allow the marksman another chance  to kill him (33). This only
seems fair to Billy, but the point is well made that there are no
rules, morals, or justice in war.
    Vonnegut further satirizes war when Billy watches a war movie
in  reverse  (74-5).  The  war   going  backwards  is  silly  and
wonderful, humorous  and beautiful. It shows  people using common
sense,   showing   compassion,    using   common   decency,   and
demonstrating intelligence,  four things that  are always missing
from warfare and massacres. Then, just a short while later in the
book, Vonnegut uses more satire to reinforce the ignorance of war
when he has Elliot Rosewater  say that the attractive thing about
war is that  absolutely everybody gets a little  something out of
it  (SF  111).  Somehow  Rosewater  has  failed  to remember that
135,000 Dresdeners who got absolutely nothing out of the war.
    A very subtle comment is made on the destructive capabilities
of war when Billy and the Three Musketeers are forced to leave an
unambiguous trail  behind them due to  the fact that there  is no
undergrowth beneath  the pine trees,  and four inches  of snow is
blanketing  the ground  (39). Since  the pines  were "planted  in
ranks and files," it becomes apparent that the pines were planted
as  part of  a reforestation  project undertaken  since World War
I had destroyed much of Europe. Even though more than two decades
have  passed since  this forest  was replanted,  it still  hasn't
fully  rejuvenated  itself,  as  the  lack  of undergrowth shows.
Vonnegut realizes that while a war  may last but a few years, its
consequences,  in  many  different   manifestations,  go  on  for
decades.
    One  of  the  best  metaphors  in  Slaughterhouse-Five is the
recurring use of tying together sex and war. The first time these
two  acts are  mentioned as  nearly being  twins is when Vonnegut
mentions that both  war and sex use the term  "mopping up" in the
same sort of post-coital, satisfied way (52). Both are done after
a successful conquest. We then come across the close relationship
between sex  and war when  Vonnegut writes about  Billy's wedding
night. He  and Valencia have just  made love for the  first time,
and shortly after the sex act she asks Billy about the war, which
is  "a  simple-minded  thing  for  a  female  Earthling to do, to
associate sex  and glamor with  war" (121). Not  that women alone
are guilty  of associating sex and  war together. Harvard history
professor Bertram Copeland Rumfoord ends  up in the same hospital
room as Billy, and it happens  that Rumfoord is writing a history
of the  Dresden firebombing, the  first such history  of it, even
though  it occurred  twenty-three years  earlier. When Rumfoord's
wife asks him why the government kept the bombing a secret for so
long, Rumfoord replies that the  government was afraid that a lot
of people wouldn't agree that what  they did was such a wonderful
thing (191).  This is very  indicative of a  juvenile approach to
a sexual  conquest.  A  nineteen-year  old  boy  who has sex with
a sixteen-year old  girl might gain  great satisfaction from  his
act; however, he realizes that should his or her parents find out
about it,  he could face  some dire repercussions.  Thus, he only
tells  a couple  of close,  trusted peers  of his  macho triumph.
Subtly,  Vonnegut has  managed to  show how  war and  sex are  so
closely tied together psychologically.
    One of  the worst atrocities  of war is  that those in  one's
regiment  become family,  and, too,  too often,  many members  of
a soldier's family end up getting killed, often right in front of
the  soldier  (66).  This  is  usually  a tremendous hardship for
a person to  bear, and in  the military, one  is to take  it like
a man;  in other  words, suppress  all emotions,  which leads  to
psycholgical instability.
    Other perils  of war tend  to the physical.  As a POW,  great
pain  is felt  as the  prisoners  get  little to  eat, and  their
stomachs shrivel and become as sore as a boil (92). POW's tend to
become so dilapidated that when  the general public is exposed to
them, they have no fear, because the POW's are no longer fighting
and killing  machines; they have  become fools. They  have become
light opera (150).
    When  Billy is  on Tralfamadore  he brings  up the subject of
war. He  hasn't noticed any  conflict on Tralfamadore,  and after
speaking to  the crowd of  Tralfamadorians that have  come to see
him in their zoo about how  evil and ignorant Earthlings are with
their wars and massacres, and  how Earthlings must be the terrors
of the Universe, and then asks the Tralfamadorians for the secret
of  peace, they  inform him  by their  actions that  he is  being
stupid  (116).  Harkening  back  to  the  anti-glacier book idea,
Vonnegut is showing how the human race will always partake of the
evil venture  of war, even  though it's the  Tralfamadorians, and
not Earthlings,  who will cause the  destruction of the Universe.
Billy  is given  a hint,  though, as  to how  Earth could be more
peaceful: "'Ignore  the awful times, and  concentrate on the good
ones'"  (117).  Vonnegut  realizes  that  we  take  the  opposite
approach. We spend billions of dollars making war movies that are
glamorous, we spend  most of our time in  history classes focused
on wars, conflicts, and massacres, and  we go to great lengths to
erect  statues  and  monuments  to  bring  glory  to our greatest
generals  -  the  ones  who  were  most  adept at murdering other
people.
    An  unnamed   German  major  makes  a   brief  but  important
appearance when Billy  and his fellow POW's are  staying with the
British POW's. The German major has  become a close friend of the
Englishmen, visiting  them nearly every  day, playing games  with
them,  teaching  them  conversational  German,  and playing their
piano (128). Because  these people have taken the  time to get to
know each other,  they have torn down the  walls of animosity and
hatred, they  have reached beyond the  political and governmental
propaganda to  find out that they  are more like each  other than
they ever would have realized otherwise. Vonnegut is aware of the
power  of communication  and how  we can  use it  to form  a more
peaceful world. He returns to this thought in Slapstick. With the
establishment  of government-issue  middle names  and numbers, it
has now become impossible for  a battle to rage between strangers
- no matter who fights whom, everybody will have relatives on the
other  side  -  and  this  will  help  keep  the scope of wars to
a minimum,  though it  won't abolish  them, for  peace is  always
being found,  then lost, then found  again, only to be  lost once
more  (219-20). The  saddest thing  about all  of this losing and
finding and losing is that so many people, if not everybody, ends
up  paying a  price, especially   the children  of those  who are
killed (SF  134-5). Because of the  huge government machines that
run our planet,  wars are always breaking out,  and Vonnegut uses
Paul Lazzarro as a microcosm to show this. Lazzarro liked to kill
his enemies,  whether his enemy was  a dog or Billy  Pilgrim, but
only if the  person or animal had it coming  to them (SF 140). As
far as Lazzarro was concerned, if a person had it coming to them,
his   having   them   murdered   was   justified.   Likewise  for
a government. If the oligarchy that runs our democracy decides it
doesn't  like Hitler,  Ho  Chi  Minh, another  country's economic
advantage  over us  in a   certain area  (i.e. Iraq),  or another
country's  political ideology,  then the  oligarchy will convince
itself that justice will be served if we defeat the other country
in a  military confrontation, and the  political machine will set
to  work,  through  the  media's  assistance,  in  convincing the
country that military action isn't just needed, it's right.
    One  of the  sad things  about  war  is that  it strips  away
individuality;  it turns  people into  machines that  merely obey
orders and kill (SF 164),  which the military hierarchy thinks is
wonderful,  being as  they see  people as  nothing more  than the
necessary means  towards achieving the  end they desire  (SF 192,
193).  There  isn't  much  that  pleases  a high-ranking military
official  more than  seeing a  weak or  inconvenient person  die;
it's  one  less  factor  in  their  equation.  War provides these
officials  with  a  legal,  even  justified,  means for murdering
people, for getting  them out of their way  (SF 180). Ironically,
the use of mass murdering  techniques is justified by saying that
they  are  stopping  other  people  from  mass murdering (SF 186,
187). It is here that Vonnegut would have made one of his revered
influences,  George Orwell,  proud, for  Vonnegut skillfully uses
double-speak to make his point.
    In Breakfast  of Champions, Vonnegut  doesn't deal nearly  as
much with  war, but he still  lets his views of  it be known, not
wasting any time getting to it. In the preface, Vonnegut mentions
that his birthday happened to fall on a day that used to be known
as Armistice Day. That was the day that millions upon millions of
human beings stopped  butchering one another (6). This  is one of
the few proper ways to refer to a war. Guns, the major instrument
of this butchering, have only one  use, which is to make holes in
human beings (49). It seems safe to say that Vonnegut would agree
with  some   form  of  gun  control   legislation  to  limit  the
destruction done with these butchering instruments.
    Another  comment Vonnegut  makes  about  war in  Breakfast of
Champions returns to the environmental consequences of it that he
touched upon in Slaughterhouse-Five.  We blatantly used chemicals
in Vietnam  with the expressed  purpose of destroying  as many of
the plants and trees that we could so that it would be harder for
communists in that country to hide from our airplanes (85-6). The
truck driver who mentions this says that producing chemicals like
that  is tantamount  to committing  suicide. Through  this little
scene,  Vonnegut  has  brought  to  the  reader's  attention  the
genocidic  aspects  of  our  culture,  in  that  so  many  of the
seemingly insignificant acts of our lives are going a long way to
destroying our world.
    The  rest  of  Vonnegut's  comments  on  war  in Breakfast of
Champions  don't  deal  with  war  itself,  but with the military
apparatus that prepares people for war. Vonnegut starts by making
the passing comment  that West Point is a  place that turns young
men into homicidal  maniacs for use in war  (153). He later turns
to Bunny  Hoover, the homosexual son  of co-lead character Dwayne
Hoover,  who  Dwayne  had  sent  away  to  military  school,  "an
institution  to  homicide  and  absolutely  humorless  obedience"
(179).  The reason  Dwayne had  sent little  ten- year  old Bunny
there was  that Bunny had said  he wished he was  a woman because
men so often did cruel and ugly things (180). In sending Bunny to
military school, Dwayne reinforced to  his son just how cruel and
ugly men  can be. Vonnegut goes  on to point out  that so much of
what the  military teaches is  silly, like creeping  and crawling
through shrubbery, and being able to peek around a corner without
being seen (180),  but that that is all  part of the brainwashing
involved in making people into insufferably brainless, humorless,
heartless soldiers (184).
    In Slapstick,  Vonnegut makes only a  few comments in regards
to war, and he saves them for the end of the novel, which is part
of the reason that the conclusion is the most powerful section of
the book. His most stinging  comment is when several people scold
a man  for his  military ardor  (213). The  man is  chastised for
approaching war as  something that is fun when  it is actually of
the most tragic  nature. This man is further  admonished as being
no better  than a deadly  germ if  he  can kill for  joy, for all
people  are human  beings, no  better or  worse than  anyone else
(214).
    Jailbird  doesn't say  too much  about war  either, but in it
Vonnegut points  out that there is  nothing else in life  that is
nearly so obsessive as war, that people become fanatical monks in
the  service of  it (71).  He  also  hints that  the mere  act of
putting a gun  in a person's hands is enough  to lead that person
to  suspend their  use of  common sense,  which Vonnegut  relates
through  his  recounting  of  the  Kent  State tragedy during the
Vietnam conflict (75-6).
    The  pacifism of  Vonnegut, and  his contempt  for all things
military,  becomes quite  clear upon  reading any  of these  four
novels.  He  presents  his   pacifism  by  being  subtle,  brash,
satirical, and  honest. Regardless of  his method, his  views are
clearly heard and understood.
