<b><u>Ethics, Values, and Money</b></u>
    People who are part of the status quo and/or unacquainted with
Vonnegut  may  find  some  of  his  views  on  ethics  and  values
preposterous  or blatantly  wrong, but  after ruminating  upon his
opinions, it will be hard for anyone to disagree with him.
    The foundation on which Vonnegut  bases his views in this area
is  that people  have no  idea about  what's really  important (SF
46). He further establishes this  point with a Kilgore Trout story
entitled   The  Barring-gaffner   of  Bagnialto   or  This  Year's
Masterpiece in which the prices of works of art are established by
lottery on the planet Bagnialto (BC 128-9). Values are trivial and
personal, and,  personally, Vonnegut thinks our  values are messed
up.
    First of all, we value those most useless of commodities, gold
and jewels, above  all else (BC 24; S  205). These materials don't
feed, clothe,  or shelter us  - they don't  prolong our lives  for
a single  second  -  so  they  are  utterly  useless,  other  than
providing  us with  something pretty   to look  at, though  not as
pretty as the swaying leaves of  an oak or the flowing tranquility
of a stream. Yet, because centuries ago it was arbitrarily decided
that  they were  precious commodities,  they are  now worth  large
amounts of  money to most  people, and we  all know that  money is
king (SF 63). Secondly, we  equate money with happiness (SF 118-9;
BC  41, 233);  therefore, people  will do  just about anything for
money,  even if  it includes  killing someone  else to  get it (SF
167;  J  193).  When  all  is  considered,  it's apparent that the
ramifications  of the  human love  for money  are far-reaching. As
a race, we  love money more  than people (J  150), and when  we do
love a  person, it is oftentimes  because of what that  person can
give us (SF 174). Because of this  lust for money, many of us lead
spiritually  and intellectually  vacuous lives  (BC 233;  S 31-2).
This greed is ruining the planet's  environment (S 28), and it has
made our medical system utterly impersonal (BC 63).
    It's  very easy  to see  where Vonnegut's  views of money come
from. As a child of the Depression  he saw the lust for money, and
the  equating of  money with  happiness, as  something that ruined
many lives. He especially saw it ruin the lives of his parents. It
should  come as  no surprise  that Vonnegut  views money,  and the
seeming power that comes along with it, so critically.
    Finally,  Vonnegut insinuates  in Slaughterhouse-Five  that it
isn't necessarily  always wrong to steal  (145). Could it possibly
be okay for someone who is in  dire need to take a small something
from a  person who has  plenty of material  wealth? Vonnegut would
answer, "Yes."

<b><u>Family</b></u>
    The  family is  very important  to Vonnegut,  which should  be
apparent being as the family is  the main theme of an entire novel
of  his, Slapstick.  Vonnegut deals  in all  four novels  with two
types  of families  - the  hereditary family,  and the  artificial
extended family. To start with, the extended family.
    The  first example  of the  importance of  the extended family
comes in the early pages of Slaughterhouse-Five. Billy Pilgrim has
just traveled to  1958 and is attending a banquet  in honor of the
Little League team on which his  son Robert played. The coach, who
had never  been married, is  all choked up  as he talks  about the
team, and admits he would be honored  just to be the water boy for
the team (45-6). This is a man in desperate need of a family - any
family -  and he could only  find it by coaching  little kids. Now
that the  season is over,  his artificial extended  family will be
gone for  the next eight or  nine months, and that's  hard for the
coach to take, as can be expected.
    A short while later we come  to Wild Bob, a colonel from Cody,
Wyoming,  who has  just lost  his entire  regiment (family), about
forty-five hundred  children (66). Wild  Bob is just  minutes away
from dying of double pneumonia, yet his one concern is if there is
anybody left from  his regiment. The death of  his extended family
is far worse than his own imminent death.
    In  Breakfast of  Champions, Vonnegut  touches briefly  on the
extended family, just  long enough to point out  that since we are
a very restless country, with people  tearing around all the time,
it's  hard to  establish extended  families (141).  But even  when
a person does stay in one place for a long time, as Mary Young did
in Midland  City, it's still  quite difficult to  have an extended
family,  as  her  own  lonely  death  attests  to  (63). Vonnegut,
however, comew  up with a  solution to this  problem in Slapstick,
which deals  extensively with families,  as the major  plot of the
novel  is the  setting up  of artificial  extended families by the
main  character, President  Wilbur Daffodil-11  Swain. Due  to the
breakdown  of the  biological family,  Wilbur decides  to have the
government issue to each person ten thousand brothers and sisters,
and  190,000  cousins,  based  on  a  new  middle name followed by
a number.  Soon, people  establish even  larger extended  families
based on  other aspects of  the new G.I.  names (209-10). Extended
families are something we desperately need to ward off loneliness.
Our  jobs  often  provide  us  with  a  nice  extended family (5).
A possibly even better extended family can come from organizations
like Alcoholics Anonymous. Vonnegut's Uncle Alex was a co- founder
of  the Indianapolis  Chapter of  A.A., even  though he  never had
a drinking  problem. His  reason for  being so  active in A.A. was
because  it constantly  provided  for  him new  brothers, sisters,
nephews, neices, aunts,  and uncles (S 8-9). Of  course, there are
plenty of  other institutions and  organizations which provide  us
with  family, and  religion is  one of  the most  popular of these
institutions (J 80).
    It is in examining hereditary families, along with the problem
of  overpopulation,  that  we  really  see  the  need for extended
families.  Large families  make it  easier to  cope with  life (BC
92), which is  a very relevant topic for Vonnegut  at this time in
his  life as  both of  his parents  are dead,  his sister is dead,
he's recently left  his wife, and his six  children have all grown
up and moved away. Yet, Vonnegut  realizes that there are too many
people on the planet and not enough  room for all of them (SF 196,
212; BC 12-3, 45). Hence, the dire need for extended families that
is  the  plea  of  Slapstick.  They  are  needed because we become
interchangeable parts  in the U.S.  machine without family  (S 7),
and most of us in the U.S. who do have families have lousy ones at
that. We know  nothing about our grandparents (S  47), and we take
terrible care of  our relatives (S 118). Still,  we need families,
not only to survive (S 243), but because we are better people when
we have  them (S 177). Since  the hereditary family is  so weak in
the United States, we need to find artificial extended families in
which to become members.

<b><u>Psychology</b></u>
    While  not  formally  educated  in  psychology,  Vonnegut  has
learned  much about  the human  mind  and  how it  works. This  is
evidenced  throughout   the  four  novels  in   his  comments  and
characterizations.
    The  human mind  is powerful   enough to  convince us  of many
things, and Vonnegut  turns to this thought on  many occasions. We
first  visit  this  world  in  the  form  of  Roland Weary, who is
creating his own version of the war from deep within the warmth of
the bundle  of clothes he's wearing  (SF 41-2), convincing himself
that  he's  one  of  the  Three  Musketeers,  along with two other
soldiers who largely  ignore him. A short while  later Weary is on
the verge of actually beating Billy  Pilgrim to death as he speaks
unintelligibly of  the piety and heroism  of the Three Musketeers,
whom he  portrayed as being virtuous,  magnanimous, honorable, and
servants of Christianity (SF  50-1). In Jailbird, Alexander McCone
managed to  convince himself that  it was the  labor leader, Colin
Jarvis, that was the cause  of the workers' misery and heartbreak,
and that the misery was not due  to the way his father and brother
ran  the  factory  (31).  Alexander  later  deludes  himself  into
thinking that  he had a  wonderful time when  he attended Harvard,
even though he was socially scorned for his stammer and "for being
the obscenely rich son of  an immigrant" (49). Alexander even went
so far as to delude  himself into thinking that Harvard professors
were the wisest men in the history of the world.
    Repression is  the other major  psychological thought that  is
dealt with  in Slaughterhouse-Five. When Billy  Pilgrim is advised
by his doctor  to take a nap every  day, to see if that  will keep
him from  weeping each day,  which occurs for  no apparent reason,
Vonnegut  is  showing  that  many  people  are  often  troubled by
something  in  their  past,  but  they  won't  allow themselves to
confront it consciously, so their unconscious has to find a way to
deal with the  problem. In the case of Billy  Pilgrim, the way his
unconscious has  chosen to deal with  the problem is to  weep very
quietly and  without much moisture  (61). The only  other time the
reader is  made aware of  Billy having repressed  something, Billy
bursts  into tears  (197). It's  good that  Billy can  express his
emotions  like  that,  but  the  crying  incident  comes at a very
traumatic  time in  his life  when he  is still  little more  than
a child,  and to  not have   cried would  have been  very strange.
Unfortunately,  Billy  finds  that  later  in  life  he, like many
people, including  Vonnegut, has problems  expressing his emotions
- even emotions of joy (204).
    Early in Breakfast of Champions  Vonnegut draws for the reader
the  monument that  has been   erected over  the grave  of Kilgore
Trout.  The inscription  on the  monument is  a quote from Trout's
two-hundred-and-ninth, and final, novel. The quote reads, "'We are
healthy only to the extent that our ideas are humane'" (16). Thus,
the tone is set for a novel that has as its focal point the mental
problems of one of the  story's two main characters. That Vonnegut
would be  addressing psychological stability at  this time is only
natural being as  his son Mark had recently  been hospitalized for
schizophrenia.
    There  are three  main topics  of psychology  in Breakfast  of
Champions.  The  first  one  Vonnegut  only  touches on, though he
briefly returns to the thought in Slapstick and Jailbird, and that
thought is  that childhood experiences can  have a lifetime effect
on people. In Breakfast of  Champions he refers to Kilgore Trout's
depressing childhood and the  pessimism it spawned. This pessimism
is what destroyed his three marriages  and drove away his only son
at  the  age  of  fourteen  (31).  The  reference  in Slapstick to
childhood experiences  is a quote  from Dostoyevski: "'One  sacred
memory  from childhood  is perhaps  the best  education'" (90). In
Jailbird, Walter Starbuck reflects how,  when he was in college at
Harvard, his plan was to prepare  himself for a career as a public
servant. Only  as an older  man does he  realize that that  wasn't
necessarily  his plan,  it was  the plan  of his mentor, Alexander
McCone (47).  McCone had been  such a childhood  influence that it
was years  before Starbuck could discern  between his own thoughts
and McCone's.
    The next topic that Vonnegut covers is the amazing fear people
have of change.  This is a subject he  addresses quite frequently.
The  first example  occurs in  a beautiful  little story  Vonnegut
tells about Bill, Kilgore Trout's pet parakeet. Trout decides that
he  likes Bill  so much  that he  will make  Bill's three  biggest
wishes come  true. First, Trout opens  the door of the  bird cage.
Bill  flies over  to a  windowsill. Next,  Trout opens the window.
Bill  flies back  into his  cage. Finally,  Trout closes  the door
behind Bill and commends him for his wisdom (BC 35).
    The  next example  given of  how we  fear change  is a passing
comment Vonnegut makes about Trout  as Kilgore finds himself alone
at night in New York City. Trout was petrified, and even though he
had a life that was not worth living, he had an iron will to live,
which is a  common combination for people to  have (BC 71-2). Even
though most of us live mundane lives and have little or nothing to
live  for, we  still tenaciously  cling to  our pathetic existence
because death is  change; worst of all, we  don't really know what
the change will be, so we fear  it all the more. We fear change so
much that even Wayne Hoobler soon  misses his life as a convict in
prison on the very day he's released from there (BC 189).
    Vonnegut  returns  to  his  views  on  how  we  fear change in
Slapstick, only in Slapstick he's more subtle in his approach. The
first  example  he  uses  involves  Wilbur  and  Eliza as they are
growing up. They were growing (changing) so quickly when they were
young that a great gong was  installed in the kitchen of the house
they were  living in. The gong  was connected to push-  buttons in
every room and at regular  intervals down every corridor. A button
was to be pushed only if Wilbur  or Eliza began to toy with murder
(32-3). Since  they were so big  it was assumed that  they had the
physical capability of tearing a person apart, which they probably
did, and since  children change as they grow  up, naturally if was
feared that they would turn into marauding animals.
    Another example of the fear  of change involves the repetition
in the lives of Wilbur  and Eliza. Whenever Dr. Mott congratulated
them on  their healthy appetites and  regular bowel movements they
would always react  in the same way. Eliza and  Wilbur came to the
conclusion that life  can be painless if one  is simply allowed to
repeat  a dozen  or so  rituals endlessly  (43-4). The reason that
this makes life so painless is because rituals are comforting, and
the sameness of them leaves us nothing to fear (204).
    The final  topic Vonnegut dives  into regarding psychology  in
Breakfast  of Champions  also spills  over into  Slapstick. It  is
Vonnegut's  assertion  in  Breakfast   of  Champions  that  mental
problems  are  due  to  a  physical  problem  (usually  a chemical
imbalance) and  have nothing to  do with actual  thought processes
that  are working  independently  of  the physical  body. Vonnegut
makes this point many times.
    His initial comment  on this comes in passing,  as he mentions
that the bad chemicals in Dwayne  Hoover made him forget all about
Hawaiian Week  at his automobile  dealership (99). Then  he states
that the  same bad chemicals  which troubled Dwayne  also confused
the assassins of John F. Kennedy  and led to their shooting of him
(133). On the same page Vonnegut  blames the Holocaust of the Jews
on bad chemicals.
    Later, Dwayne  begins an argument with  his mistress, Francine
Pefko, and that,  too, can be blamed on  the chemicals that reside
in his  brain (159). Towards the  end of the novel  it is Dwayne's
bad chemicals that cause him to  drag Francine onto the asphalt of
the dealership parking lot and  give her a beating (272). However,
we  shouldn't get  the impression  that bad  chemicals are  always
behind irrational acts. Sometimes the cause is a brain tumor, such
as the one found in Will Fairchild, which caused him to become the
most famous murderer in the history of Midland City (287).
    The  views expressed  in Slapstick  are not  as obvious, or as
numerous, as those given in  Breakfast of Champions. In fact, they
only  appear in  one brief  section, which  starts with Wilbur and
Eliza's mother  shrieking due to the  bang sound made by  a bit of
steam escaping from  a soggy log that was  burning in a fireplace.
She  shrieked because  her chemicals  insisted that  she shriek in
reponse to the sound (65). Seconds later these very same chemicals
make  her curse  her children,  saying she  hates them,  she hates
them, she hates  them. But she soon asks  for forgiveness from her
husband for what she has said, and he grants it to her (66-8).
    While Vonnegut is known for his generalizations, this approach
to  psychology   is  an  overgeneralization.   While  many  mental
illnesses, like his  son's, are due to a  chemical imbalance, many
other  psychological problems  are the  result of  an individual's
attempt to cope with the world around him or her, and have nothing
to do with chemical imbalances.  Still, Vonnegut shows empathy and
compassion  for  his  chemically  imbalanced characters, something
that is too seldomly found on this planet.
    A  good comment  that Vonnegut  makes about  the psychological
make-up of people  is in regards to cowards.  He rightfully points
out that scared, insecure people often  act very tough, and try to
bully others  around, as a  way to compensate  for their cowardice
(S 101). Vonnegut addresses this  balancing act again, though more
sensitively, in  Jailbird when he describes  Dr. Bob Fender's love
for the subtlety  and delicacy of all things Japanese  as a way to
compensate  for his  huge hands  and feet  and all  (105). He also
touches on this through the  character of Sarah Wyatt. Sarah shows
how many people use humor to  cope with the horrors and atrocities
of life  (175). This is an  attempt to attain balance  between joy
and sorrow.
    Two other remarks  Vonnegut makes in Slapstick are  that we do
a good  job of  forgetting (repressing)  incidents and occurrences
which might eventually bring us grief, especially during childhood
(110), and that  we all hate, and there is  no harm in that (176).
Both of these are astute observations.
    In  Jailbird Vonnegut  shows  how  personality types  fit into
a society  regardless of  the situation.  What Izumi  tells Fender
about communism and her loyalty  to it simply sounds like "'common
sense on  the part of a  good person from an  alternate universe'"
(106).  People  who  are  willing  to  fight  for  the good of the
commoners are going to join  whatever organization is available to
them to best  attain this end, whether it's  joining the Communist
Party, Democratic Party, Labour Party, or an underground movement.
Likewise,  a  person  who  supports  big  business  will  join the
Conservative  Party  or  Republican  Party.  This  also applies to
religious zealots. Hardline conservative fundamentalist Christians
in  our  country,  like  Jerry  Falwell,  Oral  Roberts,  and  Pat
Robertson,  would  be  seeking  to  become  an  ayatollah  if they
happened to  have been born and  raised in Iran. All  of this just
goes  to show  how much  alike so  many of  us are,  regardless of
whether we come from Russia, France, Zaire, or the United States.

<b><u>Philosophy</b></u>
    One of Vonnegut's major assertions is that all moments in time
exist simultaneously, like a stretch  of the Rocky Mountains. Just
because we  can only see one  small section of the  Rockies at any
one  time doesn't  mean the   rest of  the mountain  range doesn't
exist. Time is structured in the same way (SF 26-7).
    Vonnegut uses an excellent  metaphor to illustrate this point.
He tells of  a time when Billy Pilgrim is  on maneuvers and taking
part in  a Sunday morning  worship service with  about fifty other
soldiers.  They  are  informed  by  an  umpire  that they had been
theoretically  spotted from  the air  by a  theoretical enemy, and
they were  now all theoretically dead.  So the theoretical corpses
ate a hearty meal and laughed (SF  31). To be dead and feasting at
the same time is the exact  point of believing that all moments in
time exist simultaneously.
    A thought that  grows out of this believe is  that there is no
need for a  heaven. Using the normal concept  of time, George Jean
Nathan had died in 1958 (SF 199). Most people would think that his
body was no more and his soul  was in Heaven or Hell. However, the
Vonnegut view is that the body is still very much alive somewhere,
and his soul is with it.
    The only  philosophical thoughts of Vonnegut's  that appear in
all  four novels  are that  we are  all utterly  insignificant (SF
49), and nothing really matters (SF 66). Vonnegut bounces back and
forth between our insignificance (SF 100), and the meaninglessness
of life (SF 101), and then back (SF 113) and forth (SF 156) again.
Yet all of his brief  comments and asides about our insignificance
and the belief  that nothing matters can be summed  up in the last
line  of Slaughterhouse-Five:  "One  bird  said to  Billy Pilgrim,
'Poo-tee- weet?'"  (215). With all that  had happened, the moments
in time are still existing just the same.
    Vonnegut  uses   metaphors  in  the  other   three  novels  to
illuminate  his  views  on  our  insignificance.  In  Breakfast of
Champions  he makes  his point  succinctly in  a brief aside about
Kilgore Trout (106). The point is  made in Slapstick, too, as Vera
Chipmunk-5  Zappa admits  to feeling  as insignificant  as an  ant
(208-9). A metaphor  is used in Jailbird to  illuminate the point,
and Vonnegut also explains the  metaphor, stating that we are here
for no  purpose, and that the  world would be no  different had he
spent his entire life carrying a rubber ice cream cone from closet
to closet (277-8). Vonnegut's view of reality is refreshing and on
target.  When the  delirious Colonel   Wild Bob,  who has  had his
entire  regiment killed,  addresses a  group of  strangers as  his
regiment, he is addressing his regiment,  as far as his reality is
concerned at the time (SF 67).  When Billy and Valencia are making
love, and  she imagines Billy  is Christopher Columbus  and she is
Queen Elizabeth the First of England,  she really is the queen, as
far  as her  version of   reality is  concerned (SF  118). Bertram
Copeland Rumfoord  creates his own  viable reality when  he treats
Billy's  words as  a foreign  language, and  even though  Billy is
speaking  English  to  the  English-speaking  Rumfoord, it's still
impossible  for   Billy  to  communicate   with  him  without   an
interpreter (SF 192). But all the  views of reality that are shown
in Slaughterhouse-Five  can be summed  up in one  sentence that is
spoken  by the  artist Rabo  Karabekian in  Breakfast of Champions
when he defines  what truth (reality) is: "'It's  some crazy thing
my neighbor believes'" (209).
    There are a few other  scattered philosophical remarks made by
Vonnegut  in these  novels. One  is made  via metaphor as Vonnegut
shows  the luxurious  railroad car  of the  German guards which is
attached to the  chaos and filth of the prison  cars of the POW's,
showing the  close relationship between happiness  and sadness (SF
68).  When the  train arrives  at the  prison camp  and the German
soldiers need to get the U.S. POW's out of the car, they only need
to do  what they could  do to get  any mass of  people to move  in
a desired direction - give them a light to go to and coo calmingly
(SF 80). People are all the  same in many respects; this is merely
one of those respects.
    Eliot  Rosewater espouses  a few  bits of  wisdom while he and
Billy are  residing in the  veterans' hospital. Rosewater  asserts
that everything  there is to know  about life was in  The Brothers
Karamazov by Dostoyevski. "'But that isn't enough any more,'" says
Rosewater. So he and Billy set  off to try to re-invent themselves
and their universe (SF 101).
    Vonnegut  makes two  quick philosophical  points in  Jailbird.
A catastrophe has just occurred, and Walter Starbuck knows what it
is - the  sun has come up again  (166). Could he make any  more of
a condemnation   of   our   lives?   He   follows   this  up  with
a condemnation of rich people. Because rich people are never faced
with problems that aren't as easy as pie to solve, they have never
lived - no one can say what they are (178).
