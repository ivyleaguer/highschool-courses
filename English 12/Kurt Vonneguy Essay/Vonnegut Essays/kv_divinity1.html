<b><u>Introduction</u></b>

    If  you have  ever read   any book  by the  infamous American
writer Kurt  Vonnegut, several things have  certainly caught your
attention.  It  is  not  only  his  unusual  style that makes him
special in  contemporary American literature. It  is not only the
skill with which he manages to convey the main message to readers
of various  age groups. It is  not only the message  itself which
always makes people think and  discover startling facts about our
world. What I  find most interesting and what  I decided to focus
this essay on,  is Vonnegut's image of Humanity  and Divinity and
the relation of these two poles.
    You may  have noticed that Kurt  Vonnegut's works seldom have
a villain and hero characters. This  has been observed by many of
his  readers and  many literary  critiques as  well (e.g.  Ranly,
Reed). However, I think that there is always at least one villain
character,  although it  is definitely  not a  human being.  Whom
Vonnegut tends to present as a villain is God. Sometimes he calls
Him  God  Almighty,  sometimes   The  Creator  of  the  Universe,
sometimes Mother Nature. Sometimes  Vonnegut does not mention God
at all,  but all the same,  there is always a  force that carries
the attributes of a villain  character. However, in most cases he
refers  to 'Christian'  God. 'Christian  God', however,  does not
mean that  the image that is  created by Vonnegut is  the same as
the Christians'  image of God. This  essay will prove that  it is
not the  same, that it  is very different.  'Christian God' means
only that Vonnegut refers to the  same God as Christians do, even
though Vonnegut  sees Him in an  altogether different light. This
conclusion can be arrived at  from various references to the Holy
Bible,  the life  of Jesus,  or criticising  Christians and their
faith.
    Hero characters  also do not  come easy in  Vonnegut's books.
All human beings in his literary works are little pathetic things
which  seem to  be lead  by  a  Master Puppeteer  from above  and
therefore cannot be responsible for  what they do and thus cannot
be  considered to  be villains.  In his  autobiographical collage
Palm  Sunday, Vonnegut  himself says  that his  books argue  that
"most  human  behavior,  no  matter  how  ghastly or ludicrous or
glorious  or whatever,  is innocent,"  (<i>Palm Sunday</i>:xviii). Maybe
humanity in general  could be considered to be  a hero character,
since  it has  to live   through the  neverending attacks  of the
villain character, that is - God; a hero character that can never
win. However, Vonnegut seems to find  a way for humans to conquer
the villain.
    Without a deeper understanding  of Christianity, you may find
Vonnegut's arguments  to make perfect  sense. I had  been reading
Vonnegut's  books without  this understanding  for several years.
I became a  Christan and I  realized that I  was misled by  these
arguments.  However,   this  essay  is  not   going  to  ridicule
Vonnegut's opinion and show how wrong  he is about God. The focus
of this essay should be  different. First, the paper will attempt
to illustrate the images of humanity and divinity and demonstrate
these  with quotations  from numerous  novels and  stories by the
author. Second, the  essay will show what kind  of relation there
is between people (mankind  in general and Vonnegut's characters)
and God (or gods). It will  also attempt to compare this relation
with the relationship between  Vonnegut's characters and Vonnegut
himself. Furthermore, this paper will explore the obvious reasons
for  such  attitude  and,  finally,   it  will  present  a  brief
comparison of Vonnegut's 'faith' with Christian faith.

<b>Humanity and Divinity as characters</b>
    In  this essay  I will   treat Humanity  and Divinity  as any
literary  critique would  treat literary  characters. It  is true
that there  are individual human characters  in Vonnegut's books,
but I would like to generalize a little and deal with Humanity as
one  literary  character  (hence  the  capitalization  of the two
words). Vonnegut  himself indirectly hints  at the fact  that all
human  beings  behave  the  same   way  and  can,  therefore,  be
considered  as one  entity. I  am referring  to the possibly most
often used phrase  or word in Vonnegut's books,  which is "And so
on,"  or  "Etc."  It  is  typical  of  Vonnegut that he describes
something and then suddenly stops  and concludes the paragraph by
a simple  "and so  on" sentence.  Let me  present just  one small
example out of many:

              In some places people would actually try to eat mud
         or  suck on  gravel while  babies were  being born  just
         a few feet away. And so on. (BOC:13)

In  <i>Breakfast  of  Champions</i>  Vonnegut  explains  himself and his
almost obsessive  usage of and-so-on's  and et-cetera's. On  page
227 of  this novel he  draws a part  of a structure  of a plastic
molecule with numerous "etc." endings.  "The molecule went on and
on and  on, repeating itself  forever to a  form of a  sheet both
tough and  poreless." He says that  the abbreviation "etc." means
"sameness without end" and that  "the proper ending for any story
about people, . . . , since  life is a polymer in which the Earth
is wrapped  so tightly, should be  that same abbreviation." After
a large drawing  of an "etc."  Vonnegut continues, "And  it is in
order to acknowledge the continuity  of this polymer that I begin
so many sentences with 'And' and  'So' and end so many paragraphs
with  '...and so  on." (BOC:227-228)  "It's all  like celophane!"
Vonnegut  cries  out.  (BOC:228)  This  obviously  implies,  that
Vonnegut   considers   all   human   beings,   without  exception
("poreless"), to be of the  same nature. Let me, therefore, treat
Humanity  like this  tough and  poreless chunk  of plastic,  like
a roll of celophane -- like one literary character.
    I would like to do the same thing with Divinity in his books.
It will be a much easier job, since I will not have to generalize
that much. When  talking about God, Vonnegut seems  in most cases
to  have  in  mind  one  "entity".  Of  course, there are several
exceptions,  but these  are not  obstacles from  creating another
literary character -- Divinity.
    So,  I  have  two  literary  characters  at  hand to analyze:
Humanity and  Divinity. These two  characters, without exception,
appear  in each  novel Vonnegut  has written  and majority of his
short stories.
