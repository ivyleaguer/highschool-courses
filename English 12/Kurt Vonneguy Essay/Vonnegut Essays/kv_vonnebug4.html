<b><u>CHAPTER II: Divinity</u></b>

       The other  literary character this essay  is going to
analyse is Divinity: that is,  God, or gods. Divinity can be
described a  similar manner as  Humanity. This will  be much
easier, since  it will not  be necessary to  generalize that
much. The  problem might be that  though speaking about God,
Vonnegut  seems to  be  avoiding  talking about  Him openly.
Ranly notes that

         Vonnegut  seldom  addresses  the  question  of  God
         directly.  Through   his  style,  his   humor,  and
         especially  through   the  form  of   science  (and
         religious)  fiction  Vonnegut  is  able to sidestep
         every  direct  confrontation  with  the question of
         God. The  question, however, seems to  haunt him at
         every turn. (Ranly:209)

When talking about Divinity,  Vonnegut seems, in most cases,
to have  in mind one  "entity", unlike the  other character,
Humanity, which had to be  described based on numerous human
beings. Of  course, there are several  exceptions, but these
are not  obstacles from creating  another literary character
-- Divinity.
      This character  plays a part  in almost all  novels by
Kurt Vonnegut and is  seen from similar viewpoints. Probably
because  Vonnegut comes  from society  where Christianity is
the major  religion, and maybe even  because his ex-wife and
his  daughter  are  "born-again  Christians"  (PSU: 235), he
mostly refers to the 'Christian'  God in his books. However,
there are  some exceptions when  Vonnegut replaces God  with
some  other  'higher'  force   (such  as  Mother  Nature  in
<i>Galapagos</i>,  or  Time  in   <i>Jailbird</i>).  These  subs  titutes,
however, carry the same attributes and usually have the same
qualities as Vonnegut's God.
      Divinity as a character  cannot be studied separately.
Its  character  traits  can  be  defined  by  examining  its
relationship  with  Humanity.   Literary  theory  concerning
physical appearance and environment  is not applicable here,
since  Vonnegut hardly  mentions these  aspects at  all. His
image of  God is, however, quite  well described by indirect
indication.  There are  various hints  throughout Vonnegut's
books as to what is God really like, some mentioned by other
literary characters, some stated directly by the narrator of
the story or Vonnegut himself.

<b>Lack of Concern</b>
      There is only one quality  which could be isolated and
studied independently on the relationship with Humanity: the
lack  of  concern  for  anything,  indifference and laziness
(something so much differing from the Christian view of God,
who  loves  and  cares  for  His  people,  giving Himself as
a sacrifice  for  their   sins  etc.).  Vonnegut's  Divinity
appears not to  care about what it has  created. This aspect
of Divinity gets even  more emphasized when the relationship
with  Humanity is  brought into  consideration. Earlier,  in
1959, Vonnegut had developed  the idea of God's indifference
more in  detail in his  novel <i>Sirens of  Titan</i>, which dealt,
above  all, with  Humanity. In  the book,  Vonnegut presents
a new religion: 'The Church  of God Utterly Indifferent'. In
this a bit extreme concept  he illustrates that God does not
care  about anything  at all  and does  not intervene in the
affairs  of people  at all.  Throughout the  whole novel, an
outcry  can be  heard: "Take   Care of  the People,  and God
Almighty Will Take Care of Himself" (TIT:128)
      Even though Vonnegut admits, for example in <i>Slapstick</i>,
that  God  could  have  designed  something  like Heaven, or
Paradise for good people to go to after death, the view that
He lacks concern for the  human beings is still there. Eliza
Swain in <i>Slapstick</i> communicates  with her brother, she being
dead  and  he  alive.  She  gives  Wilbur the description of
Paradise  and  alludes  it  to   a  badly  run  Turkey  Farm
(SLP:179). She says that "Whoever designed this knew nothing
of the human beings" (SLP:179).  Vonnegut seems to be asking
whether such  a paradise can be  considered to be a  kind of
reward.  Since  God  is,  in  his  view, indifferent towards
people, one cannot expect Him  to be different when it comes
to the afterlife.
      Together   with   indifference,   Vonnegut   sometimes
mentions laziness  of Divinity. A very  good example of this
can be found in the novel <i>Jailbird</i>, where the main character
speaks   about  his   wife,  Ruth,   who  had   suffered  in
a concentration camp  during the World War  II. "I asked her
once  whether  she  had  ever  sought  the  consolations  of
religion in the concentration camp.  'No,' she said. 'I knew
God  would never  come near  such a  place' (JAI:29). Later,
Ruth  gave a  toast one   Christmas Eve  with these  words :
'Here's to God Almighty, the laziest man in town' (JAI:30).
      Sometimes,  it is  not only  that Vonnegut's  Divinity
does not  do anything, which shows  its indifference. On the
contrary,  mostly   it  is  the  fact   that  Divinity  does
something,  that it  acts somehow.  A good  example would be
Kilgore Trout's  dialog with a truck  driver in <i>Breakfast of
Champions</i>, comparing Divinity's  and Humanity's indifference
toward the planet, nature and  life. Trout describes that he
"used to be a conservationist" and that he used to cry about
people causing environmental catastrophe  s, but that he has
to laugh about it now.

              "I realized," said Trout, "that God wasn't any
         conservationist, so for anybody  else to be one was
         sacrilegious and a waste of  time. You ever see one
         of  His  volcanoes  or  tornadoes  or  tidal waves?
         Anybody  ever  tell  you  about  the  Ice  Ages  he
         arranges  for every  half-million years?  How about
         Dutch  Elm  disease?  There?s  a  nice conservation
         measure for  you. That's God,  not man. Just  about
         the  time  we  got  our  rivers  cleaned  up,  he'd
         probably   have  the   whole  galaxy   go  up  like
         a celluloid  collar.   That's  what  the   Star  of
         Bethlehem was, you know." (BOC:84-85)

This passage quite well illustrates how Divinity employs its
destructive  powers. <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>  describes this  in
the  connection  with  Humanity.  In  this  novel,  Vonnegut
mentions the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. He sees this
Biblical  act of  God as  an evidence  of Divinity's lack of
concern for Humanity (SH5:21-22). He seems to be saying that
Divinity showed its indifference toward people by destroying
them completely instead of saving them, not caring about the
suffering  of poor  and  innocent  people that,  as Vonnegut
supposes, lived there.
      Divinity is seen here  as an oppressor saying: "You'll
either do what I command you, or you'll die." This oppressor
does not have in mind the  people at all, it only pursues to
satisfy its own  ego. It is seen as an  evil and cruel ruler
with a rod of iron, crushing everything that does not please
it, everything that disobeys its law.

<b>Other Divinity characters</b>
      It would  be wrong to  conclude, that Vonnegut  always
mentions God  or something similar to  God. The relationship
between  Divinity  and  Humanity  has  been  illustrated  on
previous  pages,  but  there  seem  to  be  several "divine"
characters that  could be substituted  for Divinity. In  all
cases, they are somehow superior  to human beings, no matter
what names they might be given or which characteristics they
might  be attributed.  Sometimes  it  seems that  the higher
force is  just nature or chance,  for example. These things,
however,  could  not  be  studied  as  a character Divinity,
because they are  not alive. Still, it can  be supposed that
Vonnegut has an entity in mind, not just some abstract thing
as coincidence or accident.

<b>Years</b>
      In <i>Jailbird</i>, Vonnegut presents two kind of characters.
They are not  people versus God, they are  people and years.
In the beginning of the novel, the main character, Starbuck,
says that years are responsible:

         Nineteen-hundred and  Thirteen gave me  the gift of
         life. Nineteen-hundred and  Twenty-nine wrecked the
         American  economy. Nineteen-hundred  and Thirty-one
         sent me to Harward... (JAI:1)

Vonnegut even capitalizes the names of the years in order to
show  that "they  were proper  names" (JAI:2).  It seems  as
though the years  served the function that is  played by God
in the other novels: something  that makes people do things,
something that is to blame  instead of people. Starbuck does
not blame  people for the collapse  of the American economy,
he blames the year 1929. He does not blame people for firing
him from the government, he blames the year 1953 (JAI:2).

<b><i>Timequake</i></b>
      The  problem   of  free  will  in   <i>Timequake</i>  is  not
apparently  caused by  God or  any intelligent  being. It is
a timequake, a natural catastrophe  which happens just as an
earthquake  might happen:  all  of  a sudden,  with no-one's
intention. Therefore,  the reader would not  have to suspect
Divinity  to be  behind the  scene. Vonnegut  says that  the
timequake  was mean.  It is  definitely a  human quality  or
maybe  "divine"  quality,  and  not  of  something abstract,
something not living. "If it  isn't a timequake draggin g us
through knothole after knothole, it's something else just as
mean and powerful" (TQK:46). This  may be understood in such
a way that,  even though Vonnegut  is really speaking  about
a natural disaster, there is Divinity acting the same way as
timequake. It is Divinity, as can be concluded, who drags us
through life.

<b>Big brains</b>
      In  <i>Galapagos</i>, the  cause of  everything an individual
does  is the  oversized human  brain. It  is what leads them
into doing terrible, abominable things, it is something they
cannot help obeying. According to what has been discussed in
this section  so far, the cause  of everything Humanity does
seems to be Divinity. Therefore,  Divinity appears to be the
'oversized brain' of Humanity.  If one compares the relation
of an individual and their brain to the relation of Humanity
and Divinity  in Vonnegut's n  ovels, one can  see an almost
perfect match.  <i>Galapagos</i>, which, as an  exception, does not
blame God for anything, can now  be seen as a parable of the
relation between people and  God, actually putting even more
blame on Divinity than any other novel.
      Also in <i>Timequake</i> Vonnegut  says something about human
brains and  minds that can  prove that the  conclusion about
the equation of  big brains and Divinity is  correct. In one
of  Kilgore  Trout's  stories,  "Dog's  Breakfast", the main
character  suspects that  smart people  really have  "little
radio  receivers  in  their  heads"  and  are "getting their
bright ideas from somewhere else" (TQK:91).

         Trout  himself  seemed  convicted  that  there  was
         a great big computer somewhere,  which, by means of
         radio, had  told Pythagoras about  right triangles,
         and   Newton  about   gravity,  and   Darwin  about
         evolution,  and Pasteur  about germs,  and Einstein
         about relativity, and so on and on. (TQK:91)

Trout also expresses the  opinion that this computer, "while
pretending  to help  us, may  actually be  trying to kill us
dummies  with too  much to  think about"  (TQK:91). This  is
actually  realised  in  <i>Galapagos</i>,  where  humanity  becomes
extinct thanks to their big brains.

<b>Vonnegut as God</b>
      In <i>Breakfast of Champions</i>,  Vonnegut himself plays the
part of Divinity. He assumes a role that seems to illustrate
the role of  Divinity in his other books.  He is the creator
of the amber, the storyline of  the novel. He is the creator
of  all the  characters. He  decides on  everything that the
characters  are going  to do  next. He  is the puppet-master
leading his  puppets. The characters  are utterly under  his
control. The  only character that  seems to realize  this is
Kilgore Trout, who says to his parakeet: "the way things are
going, all I can think of is  that I'm a character in a book
by somebody  who wants to  write about somebody  who suffers
all the time" (BOC:241).
      The parallel between this  and other Vonnegut's novels
(and Vonnegut's life itself) can be easily seen. Humanity is
suffering and  it feels like  a character under  the hand of
somebody who likes to write about suffering.

<b>The Divine Father</b>
      The  relationship  between  father  and  son  has been
described in  the section on  Family. One of  the most often
mentioned  relations between  father and  son is  that of an
unsuccessful  father producing  an unsuccesful  son, such as
Kilgore and Leon  Trout, or Rudy Waltz and  his father. This
can  be used  as an  analogy for  Vonegut's idea  of God  or
Divinity.
      In  some religions,  such as  Judaism or Christianity,
"the believers and their Divinity formed a social, political
and  religious unit,  that is  family, whose  father was, in
a purely   physical  sense,   the  Divinity."  (Novotny:571,
transl.) Jesus  Christ also taught believers  to know God as
their father.  (Novotny:571, Matthew 7,9).  Vonnegut, though
never  stating it  directly in  his books,  seems to make an
analogy between  the physical and  human father and  son and
the Divine Father and Son -- that is Divi nity and Humanity.
      Showing  Divinity as  an uncaring,  indifferent, cruel
entity, he may suggest that  it is an apology for Humanity's
being  also  uncaring  and  indifferent  and cruel. Vonnegut
shows  Humanity   as  a  complete   failure.  However,  when
examining the  character of Divinity,  it seems that  it, as
the possible father  is a failure as well,  having failed in
creating people,  having failed in giving  them a purpose of
life etc.

<b>Religion</b>
      So far, the relationship  of Divinity towards Humanity
has been  described without any reference  to the way people
treat  Divinity, without  mentioning faith  and worship.  To
form  a picture  that is  more complete,  it is necessary to
explore not only the direction of the relationship of God to
people, but also the opposite one: people to God. When there
is a  kind of relationship of  Humanity towards Divinity, it
is possible to call  it "religion". While Vonnegut's earlier
stories  do not  mention this  is sue  at all,  in the later
novels there are many and frequent references to religion.
      Vonnegut  seems  to   deplore  traditional  religions,
especially  Christianity.  Many  remarks  on  the  issue  of
religion can be found throughout his books. However, he does
not  only  criticize  religion  and  believers,  but creates
religions of his own. Humanity  in Vonnegut's works seems to
have  almost the  same attitude  towards Divinity.  Humanity
mostly criticises  God or Divinity,  such as Kilgore  Trout,
for example,  in his speech about  God a non-conservationist
(BOC:84-85),  or Eliza  Swain  criticizing  heave n  and its
maker  (SLP:179), or  Ruth saying  that God  was the laziest
person  in  town  (JAI:30),  or  a  character  in <i>Timequake</i>,
Prince,  who gets  contemptuous of  God (TQK:56)  or Bokonon
saying  that  "God  never  wrote  a  good  play in His Life"
(CAT:161). The  whole Church of God  the Utterly Indifferent
(TIT) describes quite effectively  this view, this rejection
of God, or criticism of God.
      Vonnegut   himself   calls   religion   "make-believe"
(TQK:105) and  seems to identify with  his sister's opinion:
"If there is a god, he  sure hates people" (TQK:56). He also
speaks about his "finding religious people comical", calling
what   they   believe   an   "arbitrary,   clearly  invented
balderdash" (PSU:215).

<b>Summing Up Divinity</b>
      This section  has shown that Divinity  is the cause of
everything Humanity does. Sometimes it is just hidden behind
some minor aspects (e.g.  fate, faulty construction of human
bodies, oversize brains, people's reaction to chemicals, sex
drive etc.) and sometimes directly pointed out as the Master
Puppeteer leading  its puppets. This  part of the  essay has
shown that  Divinity is the  highest force, the  designer of
the 'amber', the author of the tragedies of human lives, the
Big Brain of  Humanity. Hu manity seems not  to be given any
free will, anything that would make its life worth living.
