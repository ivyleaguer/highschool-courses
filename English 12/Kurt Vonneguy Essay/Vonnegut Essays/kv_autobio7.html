<b><u>CHAPTER 3</b></u>

<b><u>STYLE</b></u>
    It's been said that one of the problems with Vonnegut is that
he asks college sophomore-like  questions (Wetysteon 78). There's
really  a very  simple reply  to this  complaint: "Don't we first
have to find  the answers to these questions  before we move on?"
It's plain to  see from the depth and scope  of these four novels
that pigeon-holing  Vonnegut as sophomoric is  ignorant. From his
simple assertion  that war is  stupid, to his  questioning of the
metaphysical, Vonnegut shows his  genius. Because he doesn't hide
his  thoughts  and  ideas  behind  the  language of pre-World War
I English aristocrats, there will always  be critics who deem him
as simple-minded. They couldn't be more wrong.
    The style which Vonnegut uses in these novels, especially the
first  three  of  them,  challenges  the  form  of novels, and is
a product of the  1960's counter-cultural revolution (Klinkowitz,
Kurt Vonnegut 69). The technique of giving away the ending of the
story at the beginning of the tale is not the common way to write
a novel.  His use  of repetition  is  a  strong way  to show  the
interrelatedness   of  events.   In  Slaughterhouse-Five   he  is
continually making  reference to a  dog barking (42,  48, 75, 82,
168). He  also uses repetition  in the pet  phrases he coins  for
each of the  novels. "So it goes" appears  over one hundred times
in Slaughterhouse-Five. "And so on"  pops up thirty-nine times in
Breakfast of  Champions. "Hi ho" annoys  us eighty-three times in
Slapstick. By the  time of Jailbird, Vonnegut seems  to be tiring
of  writing in  this manner,  as the  closest he  comes to  a pet
phrase  is the  word "peace,"  which appears  as its own sentence
seven times.
    James Lundquist has stated that Vonnegut avoids storytelling,
and  that the  way he  makes all  characters equally important is
laughable (101-2). Lundquist apparently  doesn't realize that the
most important  character in Francine  Pefko's world is  Francine
Pefko. Ruth Starbuck sees herself  as the center of the universe.
The sun rises and sets around Colonel Bertrand Copeland Rumfoord,
as far as  Rumfoord is concerned. And from  where James Lundquist
sits, no one means more to him than himself. Vonnegut realizes we
are  all  interchangeable  parts;   thus,  everyone  is  just  as
important  as everyone  else. This  is reflected  in his  writing
style, for it's part of what he believes.
    There are  a couple of curious  contradictions that appear in
two of the novels that I  will mention here for the simple reason
that it appears Vonnegut has made the mistakes on purpose just to
see if the reader is  paying attention. In Breakfast of Champions
he mentions that Kilgore Trout would  have one joint of his right
index finger bitten off by Dwayne Hoover (234). But when a finger
tip is actually  bitten off, it's the ring  finger that loses its
tip (273).
    As  we   move  to  Jailbird,  Walter   Starbuck  states  that
Nineteen-hundred and  Forty-six gave him an  ungrateful son (45).
As the  story moves on,  we find  out  that it was  on 15 October
Nineteen-hundred and Forty-six that  Walter and Ruth got married.
Walter  goes on  to say  that that  was most  likely the day that
their son  was conceived (66),  making it highly  improbable that
their son was born less than two and a half months later.
    On pages 311-2  of Palm Sunday Vonnegut grades  his books. He
gives  Slaughterhouse-Five an  A+,  Breakfast  of Champions  a C,
Slapstick  a D,  and Jailbird  an A.  While he's  a bit  harsh on
Breakfast of Champions  and Slapstick, he's a little  too nice to
Jailbird, which lacks the  punch of Slaughterhouse-Five, which he
graded perfectly.
    The  four books  that have  just been  investigated have gone
a long way in establishing Kurt Vonnegut as one of the preeminent
writers  of  the  second  half  of  the  Twentieth Century. He is
a writer we need to continue to study and cherish, for his wisdom
and compassion are seldom matched.
