<b><u>CHAPTER III: Hero vs. Villain</u></b>

      Readers are  used to books  and stories having  a hero
and  a villain  character. When  reading Vonnegut  these two
poles are not easy to identify. There are questions, as Reed
says,

         of who were villains and who heroes, of when heroes
         were  villainous and  villains heroic,  of vice  in
         defence of  virtue and virtue as  the mask of vice,
         even   of  what   was  vice   and  what   virtue...
         (Reed:93-94)

You could even say that  the stories have no hero characters
and  no villain  characters. Ranly  notes this:  "Vonnegut's
father once complained that his stories had no villains. Not
even the great book about  the fire-bombing of Dresden could
uncover a villain. But then,  Vonnegut has no heroes either"
(Ranly:208).  Maureen  Howard  comes  with  a  definition of
a Vonnegut hero:  "a vaguely dissatisfied  dupe in a  flabby
society"   (Howard:133).  If   a  main   character  can   be
automatically considered  to be a hero,  then her definition
is  correct.  Most  'heroes'  in  Vonnegut's  books fit this
description.   However,  it   can  be   doubted  that   such
a character  can be  called a  hero. Peter  J. Reed seems to
find the reason for the lack of these characters:
         The  lack  of  real  villains  and  heroes seems an
         almost inevitable consequence of  the vision of the
         world Vonnegut  creates. It is hard  to conceive of
         men achieving true heroic  or villainous stature in
         a world where  they are so nearly  pawns, so little
         in  control  of  their  destinies  and  where their
         actions are  so often subject  to chance or  merely
         "the way the moment is structured." There exists no
         place for "tragic flaw" in such a world. (Reed:209)

If it  is not possible  to find  a  hero or a  villain in an
individual human being, the reader  must once again move one
step  higher  and  get  back  to  considering  Humanity  and
Divinity to be literary characters.

<b>The Villain</b>
      The villain  character will be  identified first. This
essay  has  shown  that  Vonnegut's  Humanity  is a horrible
character.  People  treat  each  other  terribly,  they  are
destroying their beautiful planet  etc. This could mean that
Humanity  as a  whole is  the villain  in Vonnegut's  books.
However, it is not so. As has been shown, Humanity cannot be
held  responsible  for  its  actions.   It  is  a  slave  to
'enormous forces'  (SH5:164). It is  a subject to  forces it
cannot  control, forces  it must  obey. If  it is  true that
Humanity's actions are far beyond  its control, it cannot be
considered to be the villain,  no matter how bad the actions
are. Therefore  we have to look  for a character who  is the
slaver, the master, the one  who makes people behave as they
do.  Divinity  has  been  identified  to  be  this  kind  of
character.  In  <i>Galapagos</i>,  the   oversize  human  brain  is
identified as  the only real villain  of the book (GAL:270).
One  may,  analogically,  induce   that  the  Big  Brain  of
Humanity,  that is  Divinity, is  the only  real villain  of
Vonnegut's books.

<b>The Hero</b>
      Since  Divinity is  the villain,  the post  for a hero
rightfully belongs to Humanity. However, it can be asked how
a 'listless plaything'  can be a  hero, how a  puppet can be
a hero, since it is thoroughly controlled by the villain. It
would be possible if 'hero'  was simply someone who is badly
treated.  If  people  are  machines  or  robots, as Vonnegut
implies, they cannot be considered to be the heroes. Hero is
mostly someone who defeats the villain, who wins in the end.
Humanity,  however, manages  that, manages  to win  over the
villain, manages to find a way "out of amber".

<b>Ways out</b>
      It has been said that there is a way in which Humanity
defeats Divinity, even  though it cannot be found  in all of
Vonnegut's  books dealing  with this  aspect. Sometimes  the
readers encounter a failure in the strife for victory rather
than success.  The following section will  deal with various
ways out of  the imaginary amber, how they  are carried out,
in what ways they succeed and in which ways they fail.
      First, the  failure of the  attempts at escaping  will
undergo a close analysis.


<b><u>Failure</u></b>

<b>"Harrison Bergeron"</b> (WTM:7-13)
      "Harrison  Bergeron"  depicts  a  horrid society where
everyone  is equal,  or made  equal by  non-sesuous laws, by
violence  even.  For  example,  slim  people  have  to carry
weights in  order to weigh  the same as  the less fortunate,
obese  people. The  hero of   the story,  a young  man named
Harrison Bergeron,  who is unwilling  to be subject  to such
laws, is  set in prison.  However, he manages  to escape. He
gets to the  television and tries to revive  the people, the
nation,  the humankind.  He starts  with choosing  his mate:
a brave ballerina. He removes all  her handicaps and an ugly
mask she had to wear in  order that all the people (even the
ugly  and stupid  ones) could  be equal.  Suddenly "not only
were the laws of the land  abandoned, but the law of gravity
and the  laws of motion  as well" (WTM:12).  Even though the
way how they  managed to overcome the laws  is not clarified
in the story, it seems to  work for some time. However, then
there is Diana Moon Glampers  with a shotgun. After shooting
the two  characters, H arrison  Bergeron and his  ballerina,
she restores order and law.
      In this story, there appears to  be a way out of amber
of the world: a man, a savior about to deliver the humankind
from  tyranny of  stupidity.  This  attempt, even  though it
succeeds for a  few moments is suddenly doomed.  The tool of
damnation  is Diana  Moon Glampers,  a character  which also
appears in <i>God  Bless You, Mr. Rosewater</i>. In  this novel she
is described as the most miserable of creatures,

         a sixty-eight-year-old   virgin   who,   by  almost
         everybody's standards, was too dumb to live. ... No
         one  had ever  loved her.  There was  no reason why
         anybody should.  She was ugly,  stupid, and boring.
         (ROS:56)

The  ending   of  "Harrison  Bergeron"  only   adds  to  the
hopelesness  of the  society and  the whole  world, which is
already obvious at the beginning of the story. It shows that
the amber  is really strong  and difficult to  break out of.
Harrison Bergeron fails in his  attempt and the entire story
can be seen as a failure in escaping.

<b>"The Euphio Question"</b> (WTM:177-192)
      In "The Euphio Question" Vonnegut tries to give people
something to  enjoy, something to help  them deal with life,
which is too difficult to deal with. What he gives people is
"synthetic peace",  artificial happiness, euphoria:  a noise
coming  from space  that  makes  people extremely  happy and
forget  about  life.  "You  can  give  [the people] the most
precious thing in all creation -- happiness" (WTM:182).
      Although the euphio works,  there is this problem with
the  happiness being  artificial.  It  is not  the happiness
which is pursued and reached through pursuing, but an unreal
happiness, happiness which is bought (WTM:192). Furthermore,
the person who came with the invention or discovery seems to
start controlling the world  through euphio and thus mankind
goes  from  the  amber  of   the  world  into  an  amber  of
artificial,  incontrollable happiness.  Therefore, this  way
proves to be a failure,  too, even tho ugh happiness appears
to be one of the possible ways out.

<b>Jonah charaters and Escapism</b>
      Some Vonnegut's novels have gained the title "escapist
novel"  and  some  of  his  characters  have been alluded to
Biblical Jonah:

         the   most   recurring    Biblical   reference   in
         Vonnegut's  works is  to Jonah.  It is  tempting to
         consider Jonah one  of the earliest representatives
         of  the  absurd  anti-hero  in  Western literature.
         (Nelson:552)

The  original Jonah  in the   <i>Bible</i> was  given a  message to
deliver to the people of Nineveh. "But Jonah rose to flee to
Tarshish  from  the  presence  of  the  Lord"  (Jonah  1,3).
However, the Lord sent a tempest  and the ship upon which he
was fleeing was  in danger. The sailors drew  lots and found
out that it was Jonah, who  displeased the Lord. To save the
sailors, he  advised them to  throw him into  the sea, which
they  did. He  was swallowed  up by  a giant  fish and then,
after  three days  and three  nights, vomitte  d out  again,
a day's journey  from Nineveh. There he  finally did deliver
the message (Jonah 1,4 - 3,5).
      The same way Jonah tries to escape a task he is given,
but  is unable  to do  so, many  Vonnegut's characters  also
strive for the achievement of freedom. They try to avoid the
pre-set journey that has been  planned for them. Nelson goes
on to comment on this:

         As a man protesting his  fate, seeing no meaning in
         it,  finding that  all his  attempts to  escape his
         destiny  merely  contribute   to  its  fulfillment,
         Jonah's   story  concludes   with  his   still  not
         understanding  the bizarre  events in  his life. It
         would  seem  that  anyone  familiar with Vonnegut's
         writing   could  not   overlook  this   parallel...
         (Nelson:552)

A typical example of a Jonah story as described in the <i>Bible</i>
or commented on in the extract above by Nelson, can be found
in  the  <i>Sirens  of  Titan</i>,  in  the  character  of  Malachi
Constant. Everything that happens to him, no matter where or
how he tries  to escape, leads him only  closer to the goal,
to the  fulfillment of the  purpose of his  life, purpose of
Humanity's existence.
      Further, according to Nelson,  this view is applicable
mostly to  Vonnegut's early novels, Player  Piano, <i>Sirens of
Titan</i>,  <i>Mother  Night</i>  and  <i>Cat's  Cradle</i>  (where  the  main
character really is called  Jonah). He describes four stages
of  development  of  the  story:  "confusion, dismay, active
rebellion and  final frustration" (Nelson:553)  which can be
identified in  the above mentioned  books by Vonnegut,  too.
However, escapist features can be  seen in some of the later
books as well.
      This  is where  humanity fails  in the  same way Jonah
failed  in his  rebellion against  God. The  way in which he
could  not  escape  his  destiny,  Humanity  in  the  novels
mentioned in this section cannot escape either.

<b>More failures</b>
      The  above  are  only  a  few  examples  of failure in
Vonnegut's  books. Failure,  however, appears  in many other
cases as well. In <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, people can be seen to
fail in preventing wars and violence and suffering on Earth.
In <i>Deadeye Dick</i> people again seem  to fail: Rudy is a victim
of  guns  (for  guns  are  here  to  blame)  when he, in his
childhood,  shot a  pregnant  woman  with his  father's gun.
However, the same way Rudy  fails, Humanity later fails when
a Neutron  bomb  is  released  and  destroys  M idland City.
Deadeye-Dick  also shows  a failure  in answering  questions
about life, for  example why names are funny,  or why people
make weapons like the Neutron bomb. In <i>Galapagos</i> people fail
and are wiped out of the planet (at least people as they are
today), in <i>Hocus Pocus</i> or <i>Breakfast of Champions</i> people fail
to get  away from the  power of chemical  reactions in their
bodies. In  <i>Jailbird</i> people try to  escape from history, but
Vonnegut does not let them, they fail.
