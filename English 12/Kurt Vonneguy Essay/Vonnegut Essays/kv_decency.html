<b>Behaving Decently in an Indecent Society</b>
Mark Von Winkle

        Kurt  Vonnegut, in  propitiation of  his humanist nature,
often puts forth to his readers  a concept, by no means original,
with which all  of them can identify to  some extent: the concept
of  a  lone  figure,  a   figure  of  lonely  insight  and  ready
compassion, observing the world and the way people live and treat
each  other,  finding  coldness   and  injustice  there,  finding
poverty, ignorance, and cruelty there,  and rising against it for
the immediate or eventual pleasure and betterment of his fellows.
Vonnegut, influenced admittedly by writers such as Aldous Huxley,
George Orwell,  E.M. Forster, and  Eugene Zamiatin,(1) uses  such
figures with  their particular means  of remedy to  suggest to us
the  acceptability  of  unpopular  behavior  to  better the human
condition;  the one  hope he  cannot conceal  behind his  veil of
caustic pessimism. The societies  gone so awry, requiring fixing,
that are here  to be discussed can be  distinguished by the major
problem that the rebel attempts to correct. They will be referred
to  as  follows:  Technologically  Debaucherized, Self Repressed,
Acquisition  Blinded, and  Depressed; the  societies detailed  in
<i>Player Piano</i>,  "Harrison Bergeron", <i>God  Bless You, Mr.Rosewater</i>,
and  <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>,  respectively. These  societies, a more
explicit description of each forthcoming,  are alike in one major
respect: the  general unhappiness of the  common people living in
them. The heroes of the  stories in which the misguided societies
occur  all share  certain qualities  as well.  They each, sharing
Vonnegut's humanism,  have the desire to  reverse the polarity of
the public  sentiment. They each  hold singular insight  into the
problem  of  their  particular  society,  are  accessible  to the
reader, and are, in some respect,  be it high social or financial
standing, great  physical or mental  strength, or the  ability to
travel through time, extraordinary.  Their revolutions ever occur
to the great discouragement or  at the exclusion of their family,
Vonnegut has it,  in order that they become  total outcasts, that
their  fight is  made more  spiritually "pure,"  that they become
"outcast crusaders" of a sort. Vonnegut's own motives for wishing
happiness upon mankind are sadly obvious, as they are undoubtedly
comprised of the  sadness, abuses of science and  pain he himself
was in  such proximity to  as a young  man. His mother's  suicide
before  his capture  by German   forces has  made the  subject of
suicide a staple  in virtually every Vonnegut novel;  much as has
his  witnessing the  needless fire  bombing of  Dresden made  the
subject of  mass slaughter, both real  and fictitious, a hallmark
of  his work.  The terrible   contortment of  a discovery  of his
scientist   brother's  concerning   precipitation  for   military
purposes and a disillusionment  with the disinterested members of
the research  department at his former  employer General Electric
has  ensured the  scientific community  and its  frequently fatal
follies page room in his writings for as long as he perseveres.
        His identification with Marxist philosophy and the common
decency extolled by Jesus Christ work a strong influence in these
stories of "just rebellion," and  are used as tools for achieving
for  mankind a  semblance of  the extended  family, what Vonnegut
believes  to  be  the  ideal  environment  for  human beings, the
paragon living situation known as the "Folk Society."(2)


       Paul Proteus vs. the Technologically Debaucherized

        <i>Player Piano</i>'s protagonist, Paul  Proteus is unique among
Vonnegut's society-savers  for his inner  struggle as to  whether
his   crusade   for   humanity   is   "right."  (Paul's  surname,
incidentally,  is   derived  from  the   word  "protean"  meaning
"exceedingly variable.")  Vonnegut's other champions  of humanity
are self-righteous,  but Paul's upbringing has  given him room to
doubt.  The  son  of  one  of  the  most  admired  and  efficient
technocrats of the new  automated, depersonalized America, Doctor
George  Proteus,  Paul  is  rebelling  against  far more than the
Technologically Debaucherized system he doubts the virtues of. To
carry through  on his plans  for a society  where opportunity for
individual human dignity and identity  is possible is to alienate
himself simultaneously  from his friends enmeshed  in the system,
his mechanized and social elitist wife, his job as manager of the
Ilium Works,  and his roots.  To carry through  on his plans  for
a human-friendly society is to willfully become an orphan.
        Paul's aforementioned struggle, it  seems, is not brought
on by any one event, but by  the new era itself as he often finds
himself retreating  to Building 58 within  the Ilium Works, which
houses  very faulty  and inadequate  machinery from  times before
pre-automation,  and  is  described  as  a  place "where the past
admitted how humble and shoddy it  had been, where one could look
from  the old  to the  new and  see that  mankind really had come
a long way,"  (3) to receive  a "vote of  confidence."(4) The two
opposing  parts of  Paul are  the values  he has been brainwashed
with all his life and his experience. He has seen the failings of
machines (i.e. the mechanized truculency of a team of machines to
a cat "caught in the gears," so to speak) as well as those of men
(i.e. drunkenness,  labor disputes(5)) and suspects  that one set
of  failings, that  of the   men, is  more manageable.  Doctor Ed
Finnerty,  a  rebel  and  old  friend  of  Paul's, has no trouble
recognizing  that Paul  is too  busy fighting  that psychological
battle to  be of much use  to the revolution he  hopes to incite,
and  opts  instead  for  the  disaffected  and similarly obsessed
societal victim Reverend James Lasher to become his partner.
        It may very  well be that Paul's motivation  is trying to
"reassert the value of human love  and compassion in a world that
lauds the ruthless and machinelike,"(6) for even his wife whom he
often   turns  to   naively  for   that  lost   "human  love  and
compassion"(7) is little more  than a successful wife machine(8);
pleasing  to the  eye, sexually  adept, capable  of any number of
recitations  reaffirming her  love and  devotion, and  her life's
purpose,  which  is  to  say,  ensuring  her  and  Paul's  social
advancement, is distracted by nothing.
        It  is interesting  to find  that Paul,  having had every
reason to suspect that he was  the sole dissenting muted voice in
his society, becomes, in the end, the least crucial human element
of either the planners or soldiers in what comes to be called the
Ghost  Shirt Society,  the anti-machinists.  In a  twist of fate,
Paul never gains the opportunity  to quit the system symbolically
and nobly  as he had planned  to. It is Dr.  Fred Garth who takes
greater action  against the managers  and engineers by  stripping
the bark of the Meadows Oak,  one of its most recognized symbols.
It is Reverend Lasher who  formulates the vision of the rebellion
and  propagates  it.  It  is  Professor  Ludwig  von  Neumann who
articulates  that  vision.  If   not  for  Doctor  Finnerty,  the
Society's co-organizer  with Lasher, Paul  would never have  been
even the figurehead for the cause but would indeed have been left
on  the other  side of  the rebellion.  It is  his aforementioned
inner struggle that causes this dragging of Paul's feet in making
himself known  as a philosophical  deviant. His psyche  will only
allow him  to undertake small, warm-up  rebellions such as buying
a house with no electricity and  slumming in Homestead, the realm
of the uneducated, with the well known mischief-maker Finnerty.
        Paul's pain is that of sightedness in a world of blind
men. To speak  out against such a place from  within such a place
is a feat requiring the strongest  moral assurance, and it is his
looming fear of abandonment and isolation that prevent his taking
a stronger stance.
        The Ghost Shirts' Rebellion is only successful in that it
brings their grievance against the  inhumanity of machines to men
to  the  public  eye  on  a  grand  scale  as revolts were staged
simultaneously across the nation in key cities such as St. Louis,
Chicago, and of  course, Ilium. As the book  closes with the four
leaders of  the group surrendering  to the authorities,  there is
the hope that some good has  been done in jolting the public into
giving  attention to  the way  they are  living, and  questioning
whether it is by the law of men or machines.


                     Self-Repressed No More!

        Vonnegut created  the most romantically  appealing of all
his  reformers  when  he   created  Harrison  Bergeron  to  whose
effectiveness,   purity  of   purpose,  and   methods  both   his
predecessor  Paul  Proteus  and  successors  Elliot Rosewater and
Billy  Pilgrim, it  might be   said, emulate  to a  small degree.
Harrison's  effectiveness  for  the   reader  benefits  from  the
story's  brevity as  well as  from his  own unbelievable,  almost
godlike,  intellect and  physical might  and beauty.  He and  his
story  come  to  us  as  does  the  sound  of  a  gunshot;  fast,
impressive,   and  with   an  indisputable   meaning.  With  this
character, Vonnegut gives  us much more than an  ideal to live up
to.
        Born  in an  America which  under the  211th, 212th,  and
213th amendments  to the Constitution  handicaps every individual
until  he  or  she  is  only  as  capable  as  the most incapable
naturally  occurring citizen  with sandbags  to inhibit movement,
powerful  eyeglasses to  inhibit  good  vision, masks  to contain
beauty,  and noisy  head radios  to reroute  overlong streams  of
thought,  Harrison,  stunningly  endowed  in  every  respect,  is
hindered in a stunningly overt fashion.
        His  mother and  father are  too distracted  by their own
prescribed handicaps  to aid him in  his revolution. Harrison, as
is typical of the  Vonnegutian "justified rebels," fights without
understanding  from his  family.  Taking  over a  live television
broadcast  to  demonstrate  the  true  capabilities  of  not only
himself,  but  also  a  previously  awkward  ballet  dancer,  and
previously shoddy  musicians by removing  their handicaps results
in his televised murder by the United States Handicapper General,
Diana Moon Glampers.
        Harrison,  born  perfect,  resents  the  insane manner in
which  any ability  not held  in common  with all  of mankind  is
outlawed in  the Self-Repressed United States  of 2081. Like Paul
Proteus,  he   is  a  natural   holder  of  insight   as  to  the
uninhibitive, free-thinking  sort of society men  should live in.
His methods,  all visual and awe-inspiring  spectacles, can leave
no doubt  that he desires that  sort of society where  men better
instead of degrade themselves. He  realizes that only through the
use of our  natural intellect and strength can  any betterment of
mankind as a whole occur. The fact that his short lived rebellion
was televised across America, planting  the seeds of yearning for
a more pleasurable existence in the minds of millions of viewers,
leaves  us room  to ponder  whether his  invitation to the common
people to  be all they can  be, and become "barons  and dukes and
earls"(9) under  Emperor Harrison will  be accepted, whether  his
dream will be carried out posthumously  yet not to his undoing or
discredit.


                     Saint Elliot of Indiana

        Philanthropically  motivated to  the point  of obsession,
allowing  that obsession  to cause  him to  live in  drear filth,
revolting his Senator father, and  opening himself to any trivial
complaint  over  life  on  this  planet  at  any  time by posting
stickers with  his personal phone  number in phone  booths and on
car bumpers, millionaire Elliot Rosewater  is the true "Sister of
Mercy" among Vonnegut's savior types  and is indeed the holder of
such  of such  nicknames as  "'The Nut,'  'The Saint,'  'The Holy
Roller,' 'John  the Baptist,' and so  on"(10) through the cynical
generosity of his own legal firm.
        Waging  war against  the Acquisition-Blinded perpetrators
of  unnecessary gluttony  (whom he  was among  before unknowingly
killing three civilians; two old men and a boy, in World War II),
not  society  as  a  whole,  Elliot  focuses  on problems held by
common, and  often seemingly valueless  individuals; dealing with
one  problem at  a time  and apportioning  each a  set amount  of
graveness  and  conquerability.  He  sets  up  shop in dismal and
forgotten Rosewater,  Indiana to cater to  the emotional needs of
the  dismal and  forgotten people  there. He  is condoning of the
many attempts staged by his family to induce him to return to the
"high life," the  one he was born for, yet  befuddled as to their
lack of understanding  for his aims there in  Rosewater. "He does
not want  to recreate only his  own life but those  of discarded,
useless, and unattractive Americans."(11)  He holds a disparaging
view of the arts and sciences, maintaining that they never helped
anyone, and is sickened by  the exorbitant prices rich people pay
for  works   of  art,  supposedly  for   the  betterment  of  the
underclass, when there is more  immediate good that could be done
all around them.
        Elliot, like Paul Proteus  earns severe disrespect, hurt,
and confusion  from his family members,  who, like Anita Proteus,
are perpetuators  of what Elliot considers  most foul; the maxim:
"Grab  too much  or you'll   get nothing  at all."(12)  His wife,
Sylvia, turbulating between active support, callous indifference,
and passive  sympathy, by her  inability to maintain  a stance on
Elliot's cause, acts as an indicator of the rigors of his path of
living  charity.  His  father,  ultra-conservative Senator Lister
Ames Rosewater, the progenitor of the Rosewater Law, defining the
difference  once  and  for  all  between  pornography and art, is
convinced that his suddenly  unrecognizable and unreasonable son,
since  drinking his  way from  town to  town from  his swank home
base, New York, is insane. His feelings of self-incrimination for
Elliot's "sickness"  only amplify his overall  hurt and distress.
It is interesting  that the Senator, living in  a society made up
of individuals  so unlike Elliot as  he does, does not  fear that
some  harm might  befall  his  political career  through negative
association with  Elliot. The Senator  feels secure with  his old
school conservative reputation.
        The  revolution that  is Elliot's  life, we  are left  to
think  as  the  book  closes  with  Elliot,  much to his father's
chagrin, adopting  fifty-eight children (associating  him at once
with Abraham) to one day become heads of the Rosewater Foundation
and inheritors of the Rosewater Fortune, will go on working as it
has always worked; on the low-key and personal level on which all
problems  of finance,  animosity,  and  spirituality are  only as
difficult to  overcome as it  is for Elliot  to make a  quick jot
with his check-writing pen.


                      Don't Worry, Be Happy

        The   "problem   society"   depicted   by   Vonnegut   in
<i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> is none other  than late 1960's America; and,
for  that one  torn by  the dramatic  public exhibitions  on such
delicate subjects as civil rights and the morality of war. It is,
or rather was,  a time when the citizens  of America were finding
themselves    greatly   dissatisfied    with   their   President,
experiencing the broadest chasm between the values of parents and
their children in their country's almost two century history, and
were  coming to  the slow  and mortifying  realization that their
country's   army   comported   itself   no   less  viciously  and
diabolically than  any other in  times of war.  It was from  this
society that Billy Pilgrim, World War II veteran and optometrist,
unexplainedly sprung haphazardly through time and space.
        There  was  no  shortage  of  what  Billy learns from the
Tralfamadorians, inhabitants of a planet on which he is displayed
in a zoo  for some time, to be "bad"  moments for this society to
concentrate on, resulting in  a prevalent feeling of misplacement
(Vonnegut's borrowed  remedy for which  I shall describe  later),
unhappiness, and general meanness.
        Before having his time jumps  finally explained to him by
the  Tralfamadorians,  Billy  is  a   bit  of  a  frightened  and
disinterested   quitter,   constantly   surrendering,  constantly
refusing  to care,  suffering from  "a combination  of angst  and
anomie  brought  on  by  his  sense  of  the  meaninglessness  of
life."(13)
        Billy's rebellion, preaching the fatalistic philosophy of
Tralfamadore  is  welcomed,  eventually,  almost  unanimously  as
a great comfort  and regresser of  the widespread depression  and
bewilderment heretofore described, as great halls are filled with
those misplaced souls  elevating him to a status  not unlike that
held  by the  real world's  Billy Graham.  The easily  summarized
philosophy of  the Tralfamadorians, a  race that experiences  all
moments  simultaneously  and  unceasingly,  is  this: "Ignore the
awful times, and concentrate on the good ones."(14)
        One  faction of  society not  quite as  receptive to  his
teachings  is that  comprised  of  Billy's immediate  family; his
daughter in particular. Her concern over his "insanity," however,
springs not  from a genuine  respect for her  sire, but from  the
affirmation it  gives her own  meager self-esteem. She  speaks to
him as  reproachfully as she  would to a  child forgetful of  his
boots  before going  puddle-splashing, threatening  him with  the
possibility of an  old people's home in his  future if he doesn't
shape up, start  caring about material wealth and  keeping up his
house  again.  Despite  Billy's  calm  explanations  of why he is
acting as  he is, Barbara remains  a "bitchy flibbertigibbit"(15)
excited by "taking his dignity away in the name of love." (16)
        Billy shares a past trauma with Vonnegut; bearing witness
to an unbelievable and needless  loss of human life (specifically
the  fire-bombing  of  Dresden),  and  lives  in  question of the
purpose  of mankind,  which has  such a  great and often employed
capacity for pain.
        The success  of Billy's rebellion (exampled  by the great
receptivity of  the masses to  it) has very  much to do  with the
inactivity  it  condones  for  its  followers.  He does not order
drastic government restructuring or  change of lifestyle (indeed,
he  proclaims  that  no  action,  past,  present,  or  future, is
alterable), but offers merely a new way to more easily digest our
inevitable evils and cruelty; that is, by ignoring them.


                      Two Calls for Decency

        Socialism and  Christianity are indeed  closely linked by
their assertions  that it is best  to give when tempted  to take,
that  it is  best to  look beyond  oneself when  feeling generous
rather  than  the  other  way,  and  that collective stability is
preferable to the coexistence of extreme wealth and poverty. Upon
inspection  of the  materials  of  which Vonnegut's  "soapbox" is
constructed, two very durable pleas for decency and fairness from
these  two doctrines  are readily  identified: one  the words  of
Jesus  Christ's Sermon  on the  Mount; the  other the writings of
Karl Marx.  Vonnegut deals most specifically  with these works in
<i>God Bless  You, Mr. Rosewater</i> and  <i>Jailbird</i>. Elliot Rosewater, in
the  midst  of  his  days  of  humanitarian efforts, having amply
aroused the suspicions  of his father, is asked  point blank over
the  telephone: "Are  you or   have you  ever been  a communist?"
"...For heaven's sakes, Father," replies Elliot, "nobody can work
with the poor  and not fall over Karl Marx  from time to time- or
just fall over the Bible as far as that goes."(17)
        Marx thoroughly understood the  prevailing mindset of the
rulers  of  those  problem  societies  as  is  evidenced  by  his
statement,  "The  bourgeoisie  naturally  conceives  the world in
which it is supreme to  be the best."(18) Vonnegut's bourgeoisie,
then,   includes  Senator   Rosewater,  Handicapper   Diana  Moon
Glampers, and Paul's father Doctor George Proteus, rebels none of
them. Of all Vonnegut's  novels, the saintly political theorist's
spirit  is most  present in  <i>Jailbird</i>, in  which the  narrator is
a former  member of  the communist  party. The  character Kenneth
Whistler, a Harvard-educated labor  organizer, was designed after
a real person with the same credentials, a Mr. Powers Hapgood who
responded to a judge's question of  "...Why would a man from such
a distinguished family  and with such a  fine education choose to
live as you do?" with "Because  of the Sermon on the Mount, sir."
(19)
        The  Sermon on  the Mount,  with it's  call for mercy and
peacemaking (20),  is the fundament of  Elliot's mission. Perhaps
it  is recognizing  that the  people of  Rosewater are indeed the
poor  in  spirit,  sorrowing,   lowly,  spiritually  hungry,  and
persecuted (21)  that initially causes Elliot  to treat them with
love.


                        The Folk Society

        The   fundamental   problem   of   these  Technologically
Debaucherized, Self Repressed, Acquisition Blinded, and Depressed
societies can be found on the  personal level, the level on which
the  members of  the society  interact. The  similar way  each of
these societies  is run (that is  to say, impersonally) devalues,
in no small way, the citizens' individual appraisal of self worth
and,  therefore,  their  appraisal  of  the  self  worth of their
fellows. Having grown up in a large, tightly knit extended family
setting,  Vonnegut   finds  this  incontrovertibly   wrong.  This
upbringing,  which  he  found  extremely  pleasant and beneficial
factors   heavily   into   his   frequent   attempts  (Slapstick,
unabashedly and  unmistakably) at showing  us what change  can be
wrought by righteous fighters.
        As  for what  we  might  call "solution  societies," what
Vonnegut is  nudging us toward with  these aforementioned tirades
against the status quo, the author seems fairly enthusiastic over
the idea  of "folk societies," tribal  sorts of communities which
were the foundation for the monstrous global civilization we deal
with  today (and  in which  many people  feel alone,  unknown, or
inconsequential);  (22) the  type of  tribal societies  which the
human  race evolved  to its  current state  living in. During his
1971  address  to  the  National  Institute  of Arts and Letters,
Vonnegut  drew  attention  to  an  article  written by his former
anthropology professor  at the University of  Chicago, Dr. Robert
Redfield,  which  was  published   in  The  American  Journal  of
Sociology in  1947. The article,  titled "The Folk  Society," put
forth Dr. Redfield's theory that  these "tribes" ran the gamut of
possible lifestyles (which is to  say they were extremely diverse
in  recreation,  how  they  obtained  food,  etc.)  but also held
certain  common  characteristics  as   well.  (23)  These  values
included  respect for  the old,   those who  were mediums  to the
occurrences of the  greatest tracts of time, those  who were rich
with  memories.(24) No  specific "division  of labor"  was to  be
found in these ancient groupings  of people.(25) All members knew
the guidelines for survival, and met them or died. This knowledge
(or  acquired experience)  was garnered  by all  members from all
other  members.  They  were  intimate  people  who held the inner
relationships of  their particular society in  no low esteem.(26)
Behavior  towards their  fellow tribesmen  was never  impersonal.
(27)
        Vonnegut then went on to supplement Dr. Redfield's theory
with  his own  belief that  we are  chemically, emotionally,  and
psychologically engineered to live  in mini-civilizations such as
this.  It is  Vonnegut's faith   in this  theory that  causes the
prisoners of  Vonnegut's "sick societies" to  either act more and
more  harshly  towards  each  other,  or  become  more inward and
depressed out  of their confusion:  "This is the  only world I've
ever known, so why does it  feel so unnatural and hostile?" or as
Vonnegut himself  puts it: "[Our] chemicals  make us furious when
we  are treated  as things  rather than  persons... If  we become
increasingly apathetic in modern times- well, so do fish on river
banks after a little while." (28)
        It  is a  hope for  a return  to this  "folk society," so
similar  to Vonnegut's  own extended  family, that  motivates him
when displaying how corrupt and disassociated from being a proper
type of environment  for us our society has  or has the potential
to become.


                          Painful Past

        It  is  evident  from  Vonnegut's  persistent  use of the
"justified rebel,"  of the man  willing to behave  decently in an
indecent society  that he hopes  to elicit from  us a glimmer  of
doubt  as  to  where  we  are  heading  as  a  race. If we become
complacent   for   too   long   we   will   accept   increasingly
unquestionable falsehoods as truth. Nazi Germany can occur again,
Vonnegut knows, if we become so used to being good that we forget
we can still do wrong.
        The pain  in Vonnegut's past,  the aforementioned suicide
of his mother, the rape of his brother's scientific findings, and
the  pointless  bombing  of  Dresden  it  seems  is  of  the type
harvested by the inhumane and technologically over zealous horror
societies  he so  vividly paints   for us.  His stories  serve as
a catharsis to his own troubled soul  and as a warning to us, the
possible victims of our own placidity.
