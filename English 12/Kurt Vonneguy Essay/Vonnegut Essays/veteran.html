<b>Portrait of a Veteran</b>
The Effects of World War II on Kurt Vonnegut's Writing
Anthony Boyer                    

        February 13, 1945: Dresden, Germany. War is raging across
Europe.   In    a   deep   underground    meat   locker   beneath
Schlacthof-Funf, Slaughterhouse Five,  100 American prisoners and
their six  German guards feel the  Earth move as Royal  Air Force
bombers lay  wreckage to the city  above. They can only  hear the
mass terror  as the greatest slaughter  in European history takes
place,  killing  an  estimated  135,000  civilians and destroying
cathedrals,  museums, parks,  and even  the zoo.  In the morning,
after  the  carnage  has  ended,  the  prisoners  are put to work
excavating bombed-out  buildings to search  for the dead.  One of
those  Americans  was  none  other  than  Private  Kurt Vonnegut,
Junior.
        Vonnegut's experiences in World War  II were to haunt him
the rest of his life, and  were to feature prominently within his
writing. Two of his novels, <i>Mother Night</i> and <i>Slaughterhouse Five</i>,
take place almost entirely within Hitler's Germany. The latter is
perhaps Vonnegut's most autobiographical work to date, the action
occurring in and around Slaughterhouse Five, the very hellhole in
which  he toiled  for his  captors. The  former is  no doubt less
autobiographical,  but  the  main  character  certainly  has many
things in common with his creator: an American artist within Nazi
Germany, doing  what he felt was  necessary to stay alive  and to
further his work.
        <i>Mother Night</i>,  ironically, was not brought  about as much
by Vonnegut's exposure to the Nazis in Dresden, but more from his
impressions and experiences in  the mid-West during the Thirties,
when American Nazis were rampant in Indianapolis and his own aunt
encountered the  new race laws of  the German Germans, but  it no
doubt  drew heavily  upon his  experiences at  the hands  of Nazi
captors and his time spent in their land.
        Even  in the  stories that  do not  actively portray  the
second World  War, Vonnegut is  greatly influenced by  it, and it
appears  often throughout  his stories.  In <i>The  Sirens of Titan</i>,
"the novel's  first three chapters  describe life on  Earth as it
was  between  World  War  II  and  the  Third  Great  Depression.
Ironically enough  in this example,  the author mentions  another
major  force in  his life.  Vonnegut was  raised during the Great
Depression, which  is what forced  him out of  private school and
established his feeling "uneasy  about prosperity and associating
with  members  of  (his)  parents'  class."  Another  example  of
a character influenced by the war would  be in <i>God Bless You, Mr.
Rosewater</i>,   when  Eliot   Rosewater  is   mentioned  as   having
"distinguished himself in the Infantry during World War II."
        Between  these two  extremes, books  directly about World
War  II and  books in  which  it  is merely  mentioned as  having
influenced a character's life, are a whole series of other novels
and plays  - those in which  Vonnegut borrows characters directly
from  the war.  In these  stories, the  characters are  no longer
involved in the global conflict,  but instead have been, in their
past, directly  involved and influenced by  it. A perfect example
is  <i>Cat's Cradle</i>'s  Doctor Schlichter  von Koenigswald,  a former
member of the  S.S. that served at Auschwitz  and was serving his
time in the Hospital of Hope and Mercy to atone for is sins.
        So between  these three tiers  of writing about  the war,
Vonnegut has inflicted  nearly every one of his  works with hints
of the war through which he suffered. Aside from using characters
from  the  war  that  claimed  so  many  years  of his life, Kurt
Vonnegut is also  able to infuse ideas and  philosophies from his
days in the U.S. Army and as  a Prisoner of War into his writing.
In  his  introduction  to  the  1966  reprinting of <i>Mother Night</i>,
Vonnegut writes "If  I'd been born in Germany,  I suppose I would
have  <i>been</i> a  Nazi, bopping  Jews and  gypsies and  Poles around,
leaving boots  sticking out of snowbanks,  warming myself with my
virtuous insides.  So it goes."  In this, he  seems to be  saying
that  artists, like  soldiers and  many others,  are to  a degree
victims of circumstance. Through years of seeing honest, everyday
German  people  that  had   been  turned  into  killing  machines
essentially for where  they lived, he began to  accept the notion
that people are born unto beliefs, and that beliefs are born unto
people. This philosophy  appears in much of his  writing, such as
when he hints  that all of the San Lorenzans  in <i>Cat's Cradle</i> are
Bokononists,  and  that  all  Bokononists,   as  far  as  can  be
discerned, are San Lorenzans.
        Another  example  of  an   idea  that  was  usurped  from
Vonnegut's experiences in  the war seems to be  a caution against
unchecked science, or  as Doctor Breed calls it  in <i>Cat's Cradle</i>,
"pure research." As  World War II ended, the  people of the world
saw some of the most  terrifying effects that science could have.
For the first time in  history possibly since Ancient Greece, the
value of  science was being  questioned. People were  not so sure
anymore that science  was always such a good  thing, and Vonnegut
seems to be one of the leading questioners.
        In his  most blatant and  earliest attempt at  portraying
the potential  evil in technology,  <i>Player Piano</i>, Vonnegut  draws
heavily  on Norbert  Wiener's treatise  on the  social impact the
computer may have on mankind, <i>The  Human Use of Human Beings</i>, and
joins Wiener in a careful look  at the potential evil impact that
could be brought  on by the union of man  and machine, unless the
former could  continue to control  the latter. In  fact, even the
name  of Vonnegut's  novel is   derived from  a tale  in Wiener's
paper, in  which a prominent American  engineer buys an expensive
player piano to satisfy his  interest in the piano mechanism, but
has no sense of the instrument's means of producing music.
        Another  philosophy  that  Vonnegut  "borrowed"  from his
wartime experiences  was that of the  military's need to destroy.
This idea was, to Vonnegut, a direct result of his experiences in
the  bombing  of  Dresden,  which  he  claimed  to  have  had  no
militaristic  value.  Throughout  his  writing,  the  killing  of
thousands for petty or meaningless  gains has had a great impact.
In <i>The Sirens of Titan</i>, he writes of the Army of Mars, whose only
"military  success was  the capture  of a  meat market  in Basel,
Switzerland, by seventeen parachute  Ski Marines," which seems to
be  a  satire  of  the  United  States  Army, and countless other
armies',  seeming need  to conquer  for the  sake of  conquering.
Again,  in <i>Cat's  Cradle</i>, Vonnegut  writes of  the numerous times
that countries  had conquered San Lorenzo,  only to willingly let
it go whenever any other country  chose to claim it. Through this
method,  Vonnegut  shows  his  contempt  for  countries' need for
territory and the struggles it can cause.
        Through  the use  of philosophies  and ideas, characters,
and  entire  settings,  Kurt  Vonnegut  makes  his experiences as
a soldier  and a  prisoner in  the  Germany  of World  War II  an
important part  of his writing,  as it is  no doubt an  important
part of his  life. He is able to take  the attitudes and feelings
of himself and of the general population during and following the
war, and to  use them to spin fabulous  yarns warning against the
dangers  of  militarism  and  excessive  scientific zeal, without
detracting from his  own story. There is no  doubt that World War
II played a  crucial role in the development  of his writing, and
that is proof that at least  <i>some</i> good can be salvaged from Man's
mistakes.
