<b><u>Success</u></b>

      While the novels and stories mentioned in the previous
section all failed in finding the way out of amber, whatever
the  amber might  be in  the case  of each  particular work.
Failure,  even though  it  accompanies  a lot  of Vonnegut's
writing,  is not  the most  common conclusion  of a Vonnegut
story. More  often than failure, success  is seen to prevail
in majority of his books. It may not always be recognised at
first sight or first reading, but it is there.
      The following section will  make examples of what kind
of  success can  be found  in Vonnegut's  writing and how it
differs from book to book.

<b>"Welcome to the Monkey House"</b> (WTM:28-47)
      In  "Welcome  to  the  Monkey  House"  the attempts to
overcome  the world  succeed, even  though it  is not  shown
whether it works  in a longer period of time  or not. In the
story, the  world is inhabited  by far more  people than the
world can sustain, people are obliged by law to take special
contraception pill  which not only  prevents conception, but
also  takes  all  pleasure  out   of  sex,  so  people  stop
reproducing as well as  having sexual intercourse. There are
so  called  suicide  parlors  everywhere,  where people have
themselves killed humanely, so that the total population may
decrease. There is, however, an underground movement lead by
Billy the Poet.  People in this movement refuse  to take the
governmentally prescribed pills.  They kidnap suicide parlor
Hostesses, women who work in  the parlors, prevent them from
taking the  pills, and show  them, that what  the world says
about sex  is not true. As  an alternative to overpopulation
they offer standard birth control pills.
      It  is not  clear whether  the way  shown by Billy the
Poet is successful or not,  but one thing is obvious: common
sense, as Vonnegut seems to point out, is the thing that can
gain  victory over  stupidity of  the surrounding  world, no
matter in which  kind of world one may  find oneself. It may
seem absurd  that people would start  taking pills that were
originally introduced in order that monkeys would not behave
indecently in sight of Sunday  visitors to a zoo. There are,
however,  other  absurdities  on   the  Earth,  as  Vonnegut
describes in  his works (like  wars, crime, greed  etc.) and
common sense might work in these cases as well.

<b>"Deer in the Works"</b> (WTM:207-221)
      In "Deer in the Works" Vonnegut illustrates a parallel
between a man, David Potter, lost  in a maze of Illium Works
(not only  a physical maze,  but a maze  of company ladders,
relationships  between workers,  ambition etc.)  and a  deer
that has accidentally run into the works and is stuck in the
physical maze. And as the  employees of the works attempt to
corner  the deer  and catch  it (in  order to  eat it  later
during a company celebration), David Potter opens a gate and
the deer escapes, followed by D avid himself.
      It appears  that the Works  serve the same  purpose as
the  amber in  <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>.  The  deer is  stuck, or
lost, there.  David Potter, similarly,  seems to be  lost in
the  works,  out  of  the  place,  appears  not  to  fit the
environment. Still,  he is drawn deeper  and deeper into the
entangled structure  of the whole  company. Seeing the  deer
and  maybe  identifying  its  state  with  his  very own, he
decides to let  it go and does something  very simple: opens
the gate for the deer and  then himself steps into the woods
and  closes  the  gate  behind  him.  He  doesn't  look back
(WTM:221). A seemingly  easy way out, a simple  thing to do,
yet  it  is  the  way  out   of  the  amber  in  this  case,
a successful one. However, it does  not appear to be so easy
in the other books.

<b>"Report on the Barnhouse Effect"</b> (WTM:162-176)
      The story "Report on the Barnhouse Effect", written as
early as 1950, provides a very  good example of a way out of
amber. The world described here  shows violence and wars and
evil  etc.  The  world  cannot  do  anything  about it, when
suddenly one man, Barnhouse,  learns and masters a technique
of  affecting matter  by means  of pure  thought. With  this
technique, he manages to destroy the stock of weapons of the
whole  world,   as  well  as   all  the  blood-thirsty   and
war-wanting dictators and presidents.
      This short story may be something that foreshadows the
author's  later works  and the  message in  it: while people
cannot do anything about the  world by physical means, there
is a  way inside the  people, inside their  heads and minds,
something that can lead them into victory with the otherwise
unbeatable enemy. On the other hand,  it is a way that still
has a lot  to do with the physical  (destroying the weapons,
killing  the  evil  people  etc.),  not  the subtle ways the
readers can find in some of the l ater novels.

<u><b><i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i></b></u>
      <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>  is  the  novel  where  the  whole
concept  of bugs  stuck in  amber appeared.  Being the novel
about an event that has marked Vonnegut most, there are very
explicit suggestions as to how one can escape the amber.

<b>A Duty Dance With Death</b>
      "A Duty Dance With Death"  is one of the two subtitles
of <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>.  This title seems  to show a  lot of
what  Vonnegut is  doing in  this novel.  It also brings the
reader upon the right track as to where the way out of amber
might be.
      "A duty  dance" brings about a  picture of two people,
dancing. It is  not that they like to  dance with each other
or enjoy it.  They have to dance, that is  why it is a "duty
dance".  They cannot  choose differently,  they simply  have
this  obligation   to  dance  with  each   other.  There  is
a question, however, what can possibly  be going on in their
heads and their minds. It is  the only way out in this case.
One cannot help dancing with  the person, but one can surely
escape in one's mind.
      Death    is    the    dancer    in    the    case   of
<i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>.  It   is  surely  the   death  Vonnegut
describes in this novel, the death of thousands of people in
Dresden, the  death that Vonnegut himself  has witnessed. It
is  also  something  that  has  to  be dealt with, something
Vonnegut  has  to  speak  about,  because  it  was  a strong
experience. Just  as described in  the picture above,  it is
something Vonnegut has to  "dance" with, something he cannot
escape  in any  other way  than  in  his mind.  And this  is
actually w hat Vonnegut succeeds in: escaping in his mind.

              <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>  is about  feeling and not
         feeling,  about  remembering  and  not remembering,
         about looking and not looking back, about dying and
         not dying, about living and not living. (Lifton:42)

<i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> is  also about dancing  and not dancing,
the inventive  reader could add to  this quoted paragraph on
their own. In  the human mind, there is a  way go get out of
the amber of such things as the feelings and memories of the
massacre  of  Dresden  and  even  death  itself, as Vonnegut
appears to claim.

<b>Rocky Mountains and free will</b>
      Vonnegut  says  in  <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>  that  all the
moments of  the past, present  and future are  fixed and one
can  look at  time as  on the  Rocky Mountain  range from an
airplane (SH5:27). Humanity, however,  cannot have this view
ascribed  to the  Tralfamadorians. Vonnegut,  though, in the
novel enables  Billy Pilgrim to  assume this point  of view,
and  together   with  Billy,  the   readers  get  the   same
opportunity. This is a powerful tool for escaping the amber.
Though people are  bugs trapped in amber, they  c an look at
everything  the same  way as  the Tralfamadorians,  they can
focus  on the  nice things  in the  world and  leave the bad
things unnoticed. One cannot change  the past, or the world,
but one can change the point of view. Tralfamadorians did it
with their wars:

         "There isn't  anything we can do  about them, so we
         simply don't look at them. We ignore them. We spend
         eternity  looking  at  pleasant   moments  .  .  ."
         (SH5:117)

It  is actually  the piece   of advice  Billy gets  from the
Tralfamadorians. Billy learns from them that it is stupid to
try to prevent wars and offers a way out:

              "That's  one thing  Earthlings might  learn to
         do,  if they  tried hard  enough: Ignore  the awful
         times, and concentrate on the good ones." (SH5:117)

It  is a  way which  corresponds with  the subtitle,  A Duty
Dance With  Death, too. People  can't change the  facts, but
they  can choose  which ones  they will  concentrate on  and
which ones they  will ignore. When they find  the freedom to
do  as they  will in  concentrating and  ignoring, they will
have found free will where otherwise there is none.

<b>A movie seen backwards</b>
      Billy Pilgrim in  <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> becomes "unstuck
in  time" and  sees a   war movie  backwards. War,  which is
horrible,  is  here  seen  as  a  cute  thing, thing full of
compassion and  humane ideas. Airplanes  flew backwards, got
to their base and weapons were taken off them. The factories
dismantled them (women especially)  and shipped the minerals
to "specialists  in remote areas.  It was their  business to
put  them into  the ground,  to hide  them cleverly, so they
would never hurt anybody ever again" (S H5:75). The soldiers
turned into highschool kids and then into babies.
      This is a particular example how one can change facts,
how one  can see humane  ideas even though  the world offers
none. It is  a perfect example of what has  been said in the
previous  section  about  finding  free  will  in  amber and
duty-dancing with death.

<b><u><i>Slapstick</i></u></b>

<b>Alternate worlds</b>
      The story  of <i>Slapstick</i> speaks about  Wilbur and Eliza
Swain, twins, who are very ugly. Their parents raise them in
seclusion,  in an  old mansion,  and visit  them once a year
only. The people  who work in the mansion,  the nurses etc.,
expect them to be stupid, they depend on their being stupid,
because they get a fairly good salary for taking care of the
two. Nobody  suspects that they  only pretend to  be stupid.
When  they  mumble  incomprehensively,  nobody suspects that
they are actually speaking flue  ntly in Ancient Greek. When
put  to  sleep,  nobody  suspects  that  they  enter  secret
passageways hidden everywhere in  the old mansion, spying on
everybody  or  simply  reading  books  in  the  library  and
learning as much as they can.
      This  part of  the story  shows the  reader that  even
though things  appear somehow on the  outside, on the inside
they can be completely different. Wilbur and Eliza knew what
the world  expected: "All the information  we received about
the  planet we  were on  indicated that  idiots were  lovely
things  to  be,"  Wilbur  and  Eliza  say, "so we cultivated
idiocy" (SLP:41). They acted the way they were expected, but
inside, they lived a different  life, a life in an alternate
universe,  a universe  of their  own, a  universe, where the
world could not enter.
      What has  just been described  can be seen  as one way
out of the  amber. People cannot change the  world, but they
can  possibly find  an alternate  universe inside themselves
which can help them go through life in a much better way.

<b>Extended Families</b>
      <i>Slapstick</i> also  shows onother way  out of amber.  Here
Vonnegut shows  that natural families do  not work very well
and  people  are  lonely  and  unhappy.  The main character,
Wilbur Swain, is separated from his twin sister and he finds
himself alone.  He is not  the only person  who is wandering
around with  no fellow man.  However, he has  a solution for
America,  he  has  a  solution  for  humankind.  He  becomes
a presidential candidate and uses  a simple election slogan:
"Lonesome No More!" His program offers an alternative to the
faulty natural families: a  "Utopian scheme for reorganizing
America  into  thousands  of  artificial extended families."
(SLP:122)

              It  said  that  there  was  nothing  new about
         artificial extended families in America. Physicians
         felt   themselves  related   to  other  physicians,
         lawyers to lawyers, writers to writers, athletes to
         athletes, politicians to politicians, and so on.
              Eliza  and  I  said  these  were  bad sorts of
         extended families, however.  They excluded children
         and old people and  housewives, and losers of every
         description. Also: their  interests were usually so
         specialized as to seem nearly insane to outsiders.
              "An ideal  extended family .  . . should  give
         proportional   representation  to   all  sorts   of
         Americans, according to their numbers. The creation
         of ten  thousand such families,  say, would provide
         America with ten thousand parliaments, so to speak,
         which  would  discuss  sincerely  and expertly what
         only  a few  hypocrites now  discuss with  passion,
         which is the welfare of all mankind." (SLP:123)

The excerpt above describes Wilbur Swain's plans for the way
out of people's misery and loneliness.
      The slogan "Lonesome No More!"  and the whole plan was
considered to be childish and ridiculous and was rejected at
first  (by  the  omnipresent  and  intelligent  Chinese, for
example).  However,  Wilbur  Swain  says  that  it  won  his
election (SLP:124). American loneliness was the only subject
he  needed for  victory  (SLP:125).  The election  trick was
easy: Wilbur promised to create artificial families, so that
everyone  might  have  ten  thousand  brothers  and  sisters
(SLP:126). He won the election,  became the president of the
United  States of  America  and  his artificial  family plan
worked. Everybody had an extra middle name and, with the new
middle name, happiness came to the otherwise unhappy world.
      Things  in which  this scheme  of artificial  families
helped  were several:  it offered  a solution  to crime, for
example. At first, Vonnegut offers an apology for criminals:
"They were not basically criminals . . . but they yearned to
partake  of the  brotherhood  they  saw in  organized crime"
(SLP:129). After  the new scheme  had been introduced,  this
problem  was  solved:  "If  you  know  of  a relative who is
engaged in criminal acts, . .  . don't call the police. Call
ten more relatives" (SLP:139). Families that had "high moral
standards were  the best maintainers  of law and  order" and
"police  departments  could  be   expected  to  fade  away."
(SLP:139) This obviously is a solution.
      Another problem, apart from  crime, that Vonnegut sees
and  often criticizes  is the  issue of  war. War is usually
a problem of  nations and therefore Vonnegut  has dealt with
nations first. The new  family scheme eliminates nations and
leaves  only families  (SLP:145). The  main character, after
having witnessed one family meeting says:

         I was  impressed.  I  realized  that  nations could
         never acknowledge their own  wars as tragedies, but
         that families not only could but had to. (SLP:164)

Further,  Vonnegut even  describes one  war in  progress and
shows how different it is from the wars the reader knows and
the war Vonnegut himself witnessed:

              "I have just come  from observing a battle far
         to  the  north  of  here,  in  the  region  of Lake
         Maxinkuckee.  It was  horses and  spears and rifles
         and knives and pistols, and a cannon or two. I also
         saw many  people embracing, and there  seemed to be
         a great  deal of  deserting and  surrendering going
         on.
              "This  much  news  I  can  bring  you from the
         Battle of Lake Maxinkuckee": I said --
              "It is no massacre." (SLP:169)

People who enjoyed  violence were not let to  fight in wars,
and neither were people with children to look after.
      The  scheme  also  solved  the  problem  of mistreated
children, children  who were born in  families where parents
could not, were not able to, or didn't want to, take care of
them. "That  was surely one of  the most attractive features
of Eliza's and  my invention, I think: Children  had so many
homes  and  parents  to  choose  from,"  Wilbur  Swain  says
(SLP:166).
      Most of  all, the scheme  enabled individuals to  find
their own place where they fit. They made this possible even
for people who by no means deserved it, for people who would
deserve something  completely different, for  criminals, for
badly behaving individials and so  on. Everybody had a place
within the  society, a place in  Humanity. "Once a Daffodil,
always  a Daffodil,"  the family  meeting tells  a woman who
wants to expel  some people from the family  for fighting on
the wrong  side of a battle.  Th is family accepts  a person
not   because  of   his/her  achievements   or  behavior  or
qualities,  but because  he/she is  a member  of the family,
a part which cannot be torn away.
      The artificial family scheme was successful. Americans
were "happier than they had  ever been" (SLP:146). It is one
of the hints  at the way how the world  could be re-built or
re-invented.

<b><i>Sirens of Titan</i></b>
      <i>Sirens  of Titan</i>  is a  novel about  searching for the
purpose  of  life.  The  long  search  ends with finding the
purpose:  the  whole  purpose  of  humankind  was to deliver
a spare part to a Tralfamadorian ship stranded on the planet
Titan</i>. The  human beings were  controlled by Tralfamadorians
to fulfill  this purpose, while wandering  and searching and
about  their own  great  purposes.  What's more  absurd, the
stranded  Tralfamadorian's  purpose   was  only  to  deliver
a message  to a  far-away civilization,  which simp  ly said
"Greetings!"
      In the book, Church of  God the Utterly Indifferent is
described as  the main religion. It  teaches people that God
will  not do  anything, neither  good, nor  bad. It tries to
persuade  people  to  stop   praising  or  blaming  God  for
anything,  since  he  does  not  do  anything. It shows that
Divinity, or  the Creator of the  Universe, failed in giving
the world a purpose.
      However,  there is  a way  out of  the amber presented
here:  If the  universe cannot  confirm a  purpose of  life,
Humanity has to invent one. And Malachi Constant does invent
the purpose at the end of the novel, saying:

         It took us  that long to realize that  a purpose of
         human life, no matter who  is controlling it, is to
         love whoever is around to be loved. (TIT:220)

This may be the key sentence of the whole novel: Stop caring
about  God (He  will take  care of  Himself) and  care about
people instead, about fellow men.

<b><i>Timequake</i></b>
      In  <i>Timequake</i>,  there  can  also  be  found a way out.
Kilgore Trout is  the person who finds it.  First the reader
can see him in a picture gallery:

              He hung  up the painting again,  and even made
         sure it was hanging  straight. "That seemed somehow
         important, that the picture was nice and straight,"
         he  said, "and  evenly spaced  from the  others. At
         least I could make that  little part of the chaotic
         Universe exactly  as it should  be. I was  grateful
         for the opportunity to do that. (TQK:154)

It seems  a little thing  but Trout considers  it important.
Though  he cannot  do anything  of much  importance (on  the
scale of the  whole world), he is capable  of doing a little
thing only  and he does  it, ceasing to  care about the  big
things, he finds pleasure in doing the tiniest bit.
      Later  in the  novel, the  reader can  read about  the
so-called Kilgore's  Creed: "You were  sick, but now  you're
well again,  and there's work  to do." (TQK:169)  This creed
saves humankind later, when people get free will back but do
not  know what  to do.  <i>Timequake</i> moved  everybody ten years
back  and when  they got   to the  point when  the timequake
stroke, nobody  knew how to live  on. There was not  any way
out. Kilgore  Trout, however, invented  one. He told  people
a simple sentence,  the Kilgore's Creed.  The y believed  it
and started working, helping other people live and learn how
to live again.

<b><i>God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater</i></b>
      The most  humane book, however, is  probably <i>God Bless
You Mr. Rosewater</i>. It  describes maybe most human compassion
than   any  other   book  by   Vonnegut.  It   speaks  about
a "fabulously well-to-do" Eliot, who  gives up his money and
wealth and retreats to a small town Rosewater, Indiana where
he  starts  his  mission  of  help  for people. Though other
people  consider him  to be  "crazy as  a loon" (ROS:10) and
call  him The  Saint, Holy  Roller or  John the  Baptist, he
carries this mission out.
      Vonnegut seems  to present Eliot as  a kind of present
day savior, messiah. Eliot comes  to Rosewater to play Jesus
to the  poor, fighting with people's  lonelines, poverty and
also fighting  with fire (he  is obsessed with  firefighting
and volunteer firemen are the greatest heroes for him).
      Eliot offers  a way out  of all those  things that are
criticized in  this book: greed, hypocrisy,  lust etc.: help
to the fellow man. He re-invents some things, such as money:
What  he   does  is  what   he  says  at   a  convention  of
science-fiction writers:  "Think about the  silly ways money
gets  passed  around  now,  and  then  think up better ways"
(ROS:22). He re-invents the term "artist" as well:

              "I look  at these people,  these Americans ...
         and  I  realize  that  they  can't  even care about
         themselves any more--because they  have no use. The
         factory,   the   farms,   the   mines   across  the
         river--they're almost completely automatic now. And
         America   doesn't  even   need  these   people  for
         war--not  any  more.  Sylvia--I'm  going  to  be an
         artist."
              "An artist?"
              I'm going  to love these  discarded Americans,
         even though they're  useless and unattractive. That
         is going to be my work of art. (ROS:36)

This extract  quite well describes the  human compassion the
book creates  and the re-invention  of the purpose  of Eliot
Rosewater's life.

<b>Summing up success</b>
      The above are a few  examples of how Humanity succeeds
in  getting  out  of  the  amber.  There  are  some original
features  in  each  book,  but  there  are  also many common
features of these successful escaping methods.
      A rather  common feature or  theme is re-invention  of
the Universe. The reader can see Billy Pilgrim re-invent the
world around  himself, look at  some things only  and ignore
the bad  moments. He manages to  change a war movie  full of
violence and  blood into a cute  humane movie. Kilgore Trout
manages  to  do  a  similar  thing  with  the picture in the
gallery and with his Creed. Malachi Constant re-invented the
Universe, too,  and found a meaning  and purpose there where
there  was  neither  meaning  nor  purpos  e.  Wilbur  Swain
re-invented the world through the artificial extended family
scheme. Above  all, Eliot Rosewater  re-invents the Universe
through using  money for completely  different purposes than
other people  do, through helping  people just because  they
are people.

<b>Messianic Characters</b>
      It has  been noted that  Eliot Rosewater is  a kind of
messiah coming  into today's world.  He, however is  not the
only one: Other characters could  get the label "messiah" as
well, as they appear  throughout Vonnegut's books. Goldsmith
notes this and identifies  several messianic characters. One
of the  messianic characters is Winston  Niles Rumfoord, who
"is out to prove to the  inhabitants of Earth that their old
religions are useless  and myoptic." (Goldsmith:1-2) Another
is Boyd Johnson, alias Bokonon,  the founder of the religion
Bokonism. His contributions  "seem more substantial, because
they  are   based  on  love  and   compassion  for  others."
(Goldsmith:3)  Kilgore  Trout  is  another  messiah,  having
credit for, for example, mental recovery of Eliot Rosewater,
Billy Pilgrim  yet another. (Goldsmith:4-5)  Paul Proteus is
identified   as  political   messiah.  (Goldsmith:5)   These
messiahs  help the  characters or  the reader  walk upon  an
unmapped and previously untrodden  path and lead them toward
the  goal, help  th em  find a  way how  to escape  from the
amber.  Kilgore Trout  could be  the best  example of  this,
having had so  much influence upon his fans,  giving them so
much  in his  books.  If  undergone similar  analysis, other
characters from other Vonnegut's  books and stories could be
identified as messiah characters, such  as Billy the Poet in
"Welcome to the Monkey House" etc.

<u><b>Humanity versus Divinity</b></u>
      Humanity  does  not  conquer  Divinity  physically. It
cannot do it.  It is not capable of being  set free from the
bonds that Divinity set  on it. However, Vonnegut's Humanity
does manage to outwit Divinity. Even though it is physically
impossible  to be  set  free,  Humanity manages  to liberate
itself.  One aspect  did not  really fit  the definition  of
a machine (as was  shown in the section on  Humanity) and it
is  crucial  in  this   moment:  human  imagination.  It  is
something  that  is  not  under  Divinity's  control.  It is
something people are free to use  at any time, at times when
they  are  otherwise  controlled  by  the 'enormous forces'.
Bryant  points out  that Vonnegut's  Humanity "is  a complex
combination   of  nobility   and  meanness,   knowledge  and
ignorance,  grandeur  and   ignomity"  (Bryant:322).  It  is
a complex  of  good  and  bad  qualities.  The bad qualities
(meanness,  ignorance  and  ignomity)  can  be  ascribed  to
Divinity, because Humanity cannot be  blamed for them. It is
not  able to  suppress them.  If one  scratches out  the bad
qualities (which are mostly in majority), the good ones will
remain. Benjamin  DeMott complains that  Vonnegut's Humanity
"serves  evil  too  openly  and  good  too secretly" (DeMott
1971:30). The outside of Humanity is controlled by Divinity,
the  villain, therefore  Humanity appears  to be  evil. What
happens  'inside'  Humanity  is  what's  beyond the villains
power. That's what makes Humanity  a good character. It does
serve  good above  all things.  Evil things  are beyond  its
control.
      The novel <i>Bluebeard</i>  emphasizes the difference between
'meat'  and 'soul'.  "My soul   knows my  meat is  doing bad
things"  (BLU:246). Soul  is good.  Meat is  evil. The story
"Unready to Wear", which was  written as early as 1951, also
points at this distinct parts of a human being: "The mind is
the only thing worth anything" (WTM:240). "[The body] brings
out the  worst in us,  no matter how  good our psyches  are"
(WTM:243). "The minute you get in [the body], chemicals take
over" (WTM:244).  Kilgore Trout  in  <i>Breakfast of  Champions
</i>also agrees with  this: "Our awareness is all  that is alive
and maybe sacred  in any of us. Everything  else about us is
dead machinery" (BOC:221). Vonnegut,  indeed manages to make
the awareness a sacred component of a human being. If people
did not possess it, they  would really be simple machines or
puppets.

<b>On meaning and purpose of life</b>
      Most  of Vonnegut's  novels deal  with the  meaning of
life, seeking its purpose. Ranly says that "Vonnegut employs
only a scientific, mechanistic meaning for purpose and fails
to find  a reasonable purpose  in either the  universe or in
man"  (Ranly:211).  Humans,  therefore  find  a  meaning  in
themselves.  If  they  seem  to  have  been created for some
pathetic  reason, they  can surely  invent a  purpose inside
them. The  main character of <i>Sirens  of Titan</i> discovers this
kind of  answer at the  end of the  novel: "It took  us that
long to realize that a purpose  of human life, no matter who
is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved"
(TIT:220). Samuels notices this  as well: "life passes human
understanding   but    not   our   powers    of   enjoyment"
(Samuels:31). It  is this alternative  that can be  found in
the heart of Humanity that is  the means by which it outwits
Divinity.  If Divinity  "wants to  write about  somebody who
suffers  all the  time"  (BOC:241),  Humanity's only  way of
winning is not to suffer.
      This chapter has shown that there are no real villains
or heroes in Vonnegut's books. These characters can be found
only  when  Humanity  and  Divinity  are  considered  to  be
literary  characters.  Humanity  was  proved  not  to be the
villain, despite all the vile things it does. It is led into
doing  them by  Divinity and   that is  why Divinity  is the
villain. Humanity,  however, could not  be considered to  be
the hero if there was  no additional aspect of its character
to  being  the  puppet.  This  aspect  has  bee  n  found in
Humanity's  awareness,  its  imagination,  the capability of
discovering  its  own  answers.   This  becomes  a  way  for
outwitting Divinity,  a way of  winning over it.  Therefore,
Humanity can be considered to be the hero.
