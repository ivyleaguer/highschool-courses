<b>Cat's Cradle Research Paper</b>
by Chris Russo

     Kurt Vonnegut,  critically acclaimed author  of several
best-selling novels, uses  self-expression and psychological
manipulation to  stress to the reader  his beliefs and ideas
dispersed within  the context of <i>Cat's  Cradle</i>. From reading
this  novel, one  might attribute  perplexity pondering over
the plot  and general story  line of the  book. <i>Cat's Cradle
</i>entangles  itself  in  many  interesting  changes of events;
strange outlandish ideas and psychological "black holes" can
be found with just the flip of a page.
     However,  Vonnegut  purposely  uses  this technique. It
takes an open-minded reader  to comprehend the intricate and
explicit  meaning  behind  Vonnegut's  literature.  Vonnegut
wrote <i>Cat's Cradle</i>, not for the  plot, but more as an outlet
for his  psychological viewpoints. This  is exemplified with
the opening line "Call me  Jonah" (Vonnegut 11). The line is
a parody of  the first line  of Melville's most-famous  <i>Moby
Dick</i>.  Literary critic  Peter Reed  points out  that "it  is
characteristic  that Vonnegut's  speaker should  be a Jonah,
who does in  effect get swallowed by the  whale, rather than
a whale-hunting Ishmael"  (Reed 124). If  the reader was  to
examine  the  use  of  this  line,  he  would recognize that
Vonnegut's intent and purpose is not to provide a reasonable
and  serious  plot.  If  one  does  not  realize  this while
reading, he  is overwhelmed by symbols  and characters whose
only true purpose is to further express the author's ideas.
     The novel does, however have  a plot. First we meet our
narrator, Jonah.  Jonah intends to  right a book  called The
Day the World Ended which is to be about events in the lives
of well known individuals on August 6, 1945, when the atomic
bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.  The first person he contacts
is the son of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, one of the fathers of the
bomb.  When Newton  ("Newt") Hoenikker  replies, he  reveals
information  about his  past  years  and his  family. Newt's
mother  had  passed  away  leaving  Angela, her unattractive
six-foot daughter,  in control of  the family. As  it turned
out, his father never paid much attention to his family, and
especially  held little  or no  interest in  the bomb itself
that day. On that day, he had been standing around his study
playing  with a  loop of  string. He  twisted it  around his
fingers in the shape of a cat's cradle and approached little
Newt. Newt, having never  really received any attention from
his father  saw his ugly,  cigar- reeking face  up close and
got  scared  and  ran  outside.  The  cat's  cradle  becomes
a recurring  item, a  motif even,  hence the  novel's title.
Newt had an older brother  as well. Frank Hoenikker had left
never to be seen again on  the date of his father's funeral.
Newton becomes our protagonist and  his life and actions are
frequently discussed throughout the book. In a nutshell, the
three Hoenikker children are  each in possession of father's
invention: "ice-nine". Each crystal  has the power to freeze
water at any temperature of about 120 degrees or lower.
     One recurring idea in the book is the idea of Bokonism:
a religion founded by Bokonon who  is living on the Republic
of San Lorenzo; of which  Frank Hoenikker is also discovered
living.  Jonah  is  a  follower  of  this  religion so he is
constantly  informing  the  reader  of  Bokononist ideas and
principles. The ice-nine eventually diffuses itself into the
water, thus  causing a chain reaction  that brings about the
end of the world. The only  survivors left on the island are
Jonah,  his new  found wife,  and Bokonon,  as well  as some
other  minor  characters.  The  books  denouement leaves the
reader  with a  very  interesting  idea. This  desolate rock
(Earth) is now covered with  this blue-white frost of which,
once touched to  the lips of a man, freezes  him as solid as
metal.  Most survivors  felt the  need to  live no longer so
they touched the frosty solution to their lips. Jonah's wife
leaves the world  and joins the many before  her as she also
ends her life through the same process.
     In  the final  pages Jonah  finally meets  Bokonon, the
creator of his religion who has taught him, through his many
books, how to  live, work and pray. Jonah  finds the old man
sitting  on a  rock on   the island.  He approaches  him and
notices  he holds  a pencil  in one  hand and  paper in  the
other.  When Jonah  asks Bokonon  what he  is thinking,  his
reply is  that Bokonon is finally  completing the last entry
of his many books*. He hands Jonah the piece of paper and he
reads:

         "If I were  a younger man, I would  write a history
         of human stupidity; and I would climb to the top of
         Mount  McCabe  and  lie  down  on  my  back with my
         history  for a  pillow; and  I would  take from the
         ground  some of  the blue-white  poison that  makes
         statues  of  men;  and  I  would  make  a statue of
         myself,  lying on  my back,  grinning horribly, and
         thumbing my nose at You Know Who" (Vonnegut 191).

Well examined by  critic Peter Reed, "We are  left to assume
that  the [history]  is the  one we  have read,  which would
also,  of  course,  satisfy  Jonah's  original  intention of
writing The Day the World Ended " (Reed 124).
     The theme of this novel is nowhere directly stated, and
is  also  not  obviously  defined  any  where  in Vonnegut's
writing.   However,   Vonnegut   most   likely   intends  to
concentrate  on   the  powerful  lies  that   can  form  the
foundation of  a society as  a whole. Though  there may have
been  lack of  clarity to  well define  the theme, the novel
still  provided  many   interesting  ideas  and  principles.
Vonnegut's view  on religion is  certainly controversial and
religion was one topic of which Vonnegut seemed to feel very
comfortable criticizing.
     Bokonon  was Vonnegut's  "excuse" or  rather outlet for
discussion on  the topic of  religion. The Books  of Bokonon
were  full of  ideas and  philosophies. Vonnegut  quotes the
opening lines  of the Books  as he writes  "Anyone unable to
understand how a useful religion can be founded on lies will
not  understand this  book either"  (Vonnegut 14).  Vonnegut
makes it evident that religion is  full of lies and that the
only  purpose of  religion is  to provide  answers for  man.
Bokonon  himself writes  that his  books are  full of  lies.
Bokonon included  in his books  many calypsos which  explain
some  of his  aspects and  his point  of view. The following
calypso  tells  about  when  Bokonon  first  arrived  on San
Lorenzo and began to establish a religion and a definite way
of life for the inhabitants.

           I wanted all things
           To seem to make some sense,
           So we all could be happy, yes,
           Instead of tense.
           And I made up lies
           So that they fit nice,
           And I made this sad world
           A par-a-dise (Vonnegut 90).

     Though  Vonnegut writes  that  these  are the  words of
Bokonon.  Vonnegut is  the author  of the  book; and because
Bokonon is  a fictional character,  these are therefore  the
author's words.  Whether or not  these are the  authors true
viewpoints, it is not for anyone to say. Yet it still brings
up a point:
     Vonnegut created within this  novel, a very well highly
detailed religion.  He covers, in the  context of the novel,
every  important  aspect  and  develops  a  book  of worship
comparable  to the  Holy Bible  in the  way that it provides
a way  of living,  rules of  life (similar  to "sins" in the
Christian religion),  and even a  God. Bokonon's main  ideas
though were  that nothing is to  be held more holy  that man
himself,  and  life  is   pre-determined.  Reed  makes  this
observation as  well. Reed points  out how Bokonism  assumes
that "things do  not just happen, they are  meant to happen"
(Reed 126). He also mentions a very important aspect of this
theory:

         "Bokonists always say 'as  it was meant to happen,'
         instead of 'as it  happened.' Bokonon develops this
         concept when so many coincidences shape his travels
         that  he decides  something  is  trying to  get him
         somewhere  for  some  purpose.  In  Bokonist terms,
         however, it  translates roughly as  saying there is
         no  decipherable  meaning  in  the  workings of the
         world, but we can play as if there were some "(Reed
         126).

     Even  though Vonngeut  never outright  states that  the
preceding quotes were of  his personal beliefs, the thoughts
still  make  a  reader  wonder.  It  is  so interesting that
Vonnegut does create this religion  full of lies because, it
may even seem that he is questioning the content of truth in
a real  religion.  However,  nowhere  in  his  novel does he
actually do this.
     This    is   Vonnegut's    method   of    psychological
manipulation. Bokononism, though not  stated as the focus of
the  book, still  seems to  be Vonnegut's  concentration. He
does not force the reader to think this way; neither does he
even try  to convince the reader  to think this way,  yet he
chooses  to  write  about  a  topic  with so many unanswered
questions.
     Perhaps the most interesting of Reed's observations is

         "In  <i>Cat's  Cradle</i>  there  are,  in  a sense, three
         writers at work. There  is Vonnegut the author, and
         within the  world he creates Jonah,  and within the
         story he  narrates, Bokonon writing  his Books. All
         three  seem aware  that as  the 'Editor's  Note' to
         Mother  Night [another  of Vonnegut's  books] says,
         'lies  told for  the sake  of artistic effect...can
         be, in a higher sense,  the most beguiling forms of
         truth.' And vice versa "(Reed 125).

     The  thing that  is different,  comparatively to  other
novels, is that the author does not try to have Jonah become
a symbol of his actual life.  Many times an author will take
a character and  make him live  a life throughout  the book.
And in many of these cases, the author's life is often times
close to the  life of the main character  in the novel- even
when the  book is "completely fictional".  Vonnegut has gone
one step higher though. He  imagined a completely new world.
He  makes it  clear in  his novel  that the  lives of  these
characters  are completely  fictional. The  coincidences are
too much in favor of the  characters for them to be based on
or symbolic  of real people. Vonnegut  makes it evident that
he  uses these  characters to  each implant  ideas into  the
story line  of the novel.  These ideas are  not drilled into
the  reader's head,  yet they  float in  the contents of the
book left only to be picked up by the him or her. Apparently
this is very characteristic  of Vonnegut because many people
think  that  "If  one  had  to  select  the novel which best
examplifies  the methods  and techniques  of Kurt  Vonnegut,
there  would be  plenty of  good reasons  for choosing <i>Cat's
Cradle</i>"  (Reed 119).  Reed  also  states that  "<i>Cat's Cradle
</i>illustrates  almost  every  device,  technique, attitude and
subject we encounter in Vonnegut" (Reed 119).
     In conclusion,  the reader should be  reminded that the
author uses <i>Cat's  Cradle</i> as a way of  communicating his own
thoughts. The  novel was used as  an outlet almost as  a way
for  the author  to "empty  his head".  Vonnegut's method of
expressing  himself  was   mainly  through  "his"  fictional
religion of Bokonism. Through the use of this religion he is
able  to  freely  able  to  express  himself and express his
viewpoints  without  feeling  that  he  is  speaking against
religion; this is because these  are not "his" beliefs, they
belong to the "religion". Obviously, Vonnegut is the creator
of  this  religion,  yet  he  still  can  use  the excuse of
claiming all ideas to be fictional.
     Vonnegut's   approach   at   writing   this   novel  is
interesting  in his  use of  two "authors"  within the  book
itself. They are simply  used as communicators- perhaps even
comparable to translators to  the effect that they interpret
Vonnegut's  mind for  the reader.  Vonnegut's use  of satire
stares the reader  in the face as the  author clearly states
that any religion could be  based entirely on shameless, yet
harmless, lies.  Vonnegut's style is  one that, even  though
perhaps  offensive to  an extremely  religious reader, still
grabs  the attention.  The entire  book is  full of bits and
pieces  that  appear  to  be   symbolic  as  they  grab  the
attention, but  are only important  in the context  in which
they are used,  and continue to have no  further meaning. So
while the reader continues  to comprehend, expecting to find
out   what  these   "symbols"  represent,   Vonnegut  plants
sub-concious ideas  that eventually take  effect. To put  it
simply, <i>Cat's Cradle</i> might be considered a "thinking-novel".
     Vonnegut's  excellent  technique  and  unique style are
unbelievably   powerful.  The   thought-provoking  text  and
incredibly-well developed characters are not to be forgotten
either.  It would  be an  understatement to  say that  <i>Cat's
Cradle</i>  is   a  commendable  literary   work.  Vonnegut  has
certainly  composed  a  masterpiece  to  be  unforgotten and
talked about for years to come.
