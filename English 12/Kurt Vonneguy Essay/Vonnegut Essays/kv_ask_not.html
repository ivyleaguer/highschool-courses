<b>Ask Not What Your Country Can Do For You...."</b>

        Kurt  Vonnegut, Jr.  has made  important contributions to
the  development   of  the  20th  century   American  novel.  His
influences  are  felt  in  modern   social  satire,  as  well  as
nontraditional science  fiction. One theme  that is recurrent  in
his  work  is  the  common  portrayal  of  government  forces  as
destructive to individuals; to force characters to do evil in the
name of good.
        Kurt  Vonegut,   Jr.  was  born  November   11,  1922  in
Indianapolis,  Indiana,  the  son  of  an  architect. He attended
Cornell University in 1940,  studying biochemistry, but soon quit
because his  grades were poor. He  worked as a columnist  for the
Cornell Daily Sun until joining the army in 1942. He was captured
by the Germans in 1944 and forced  to work in a factory, where he
lived through the fire bombing  of Dresden. This, and the suicide
of his  mother in 1944, were  the two most influential  events in
his life.
        After the war  he worked for the Chicago  News Bureau and
studied anthropology.  He has written  many novels and  one short
story collection. His  most  acclaimed  work, <u>Slaughterhouse-Five</u>,
is a  twisted account of the  Dresden bombing. He is  still alive
and    writing.  His   most   recent  published  work,  <u>Timequake</u>,
appeared in the December 1997 <u>Playboy Magazine</u>.
        <u>Mother Night</u>  was Vonnegut's third novel  and one his few
works that  contains no elements of  science fiction. Though this
novel is not  one of his most critically  acclaimed, it serves as
a prime  example  of  Vonnegut's  skill  as  a black humorist and
weaver of human absurdity.
        <u>Mother Night</u> is the story of Howard W. Campbell, Jr, Nazi
radio propagandist and American spy. The novel begins and ends in
the same spot; a "new jail in old Jerusalem" (<u>Mother Night</u> p.17)
where Howard W. Campbell, Jr is awaiting trial for crimes against
humanity in World War II. Campbell  is writing a book of his life
for documentation of  war criminals and tells of  the double life
he led during the war.
        Campbell was an American  playwright living in Germany at
the beginning of  World War II. He wrote in  German, had a German
wife, and  was greatly accepted  in German society.  His life was
the theatre and he lived for two  things; art and love. He had no
political  interests and  filled his  days writing  plays for his
beautiful wife, Helga, to star in.
        Campbell was  recruited as an  American agent in  1938 by
Col.  Frank Wirtanen.  Throughout  the  war, he  broadcast German
secrets  to  the  Americans  on  his  Nazi propaganda radio show.
Campbell  became known,  through his  words, as  the most vicious
anti-Semite and  blood-thirsty Nazi who  ever lived. He  was also
considered the Americans' most valuable spy.
        After the  war, Campbell was  a citizen of  no nation. He
was  captured by  the Americans  and then  mysteriously released.
Only three people knew him for what he was, the world knew Howard
W. Campbell as a Nazi, which is also what he was.
        Campbell returned to America. His  wife, the one light in
his dark life, was missing and assumed dead. He took residence in
a dingy New York  attic to ruminate about his  lost Helga and the
web of lies that had become his life.
        Campbell  befriended  George  Kraft,  an  artist; aka Ian
Potapov,  a  Russian  spy.  Kraft  alerted  local Aryan groups of
Campbell's location and Campbell was soon brought back into light
as  a  famous  Nazi  by  the  Reverend  Doctor Lionel J.D. Jones,
D.D.S., D.D.,  Aryan freedom fighter  and publisher of  The White
Christian  Minuteman. The  news of  Campbell's presence surprised
the American  government, who had  no record of  his citizenship,
and  excited  the  Israeli  army,  who  would  have  loved to see
Campbell swinging from the gallows.
        Dr. Jones reunited Campbell with  a woman who looked just
like  his late  wife, Helga.  Even after  the woman  confessed to
being Helga's younger sister, Resi,  Campbell, an old man by this
point, was still fairly happy to  have a younger woman biding for
his  affections. He  forgave her   for the  deceit and  they made
plans, along with Kraft, to move  to Mexico to escape the Israeli
agents.
        The trip was never made,  however, because Kraft and Resi
were arrested as Russian spies, Dr. Jones for weapons violations,
and Campbell was once again mysteriously set free. No longer able
to  bear the  weight of  his crimes  and his loneliness, Campbell
turned  himself over  to the  Israelis  to  face trial  as a  war
criminal.
        The  novel ends  with  Campbell  receiving a  letter from
Frank  Wirtanen, the  agent who  recruited him,  stating that  he
would testify  on Campbell's behalf  at the trial.  Campbell hung
himself at the thought of being saved.
        Vonnegut's view  of government as a  destructive force to
individual characters,  specifically Howard W.  Campbell, Jr., is
obvious   in   <u>Mother   Night</u>.   Campbell's  transformation  from
stereotypical artist to world-renowned Nazi can be attributed not
only to the  American government, who recruited him  for the job,
but also  to the German  government, whose outlandish  morals and
messages provided a perfect outlet for Campbell's wicked deceit.
        There are  two periods of degradation  that Campbell goes
through  in <u>Mother  Night</u>. The  first is  his transformation from
gentle  artist  to  Nazi  propagandist.  This  can  obviously  be
attributed directly to the American government for recruiting him
into its service.
        The   government  can   also  be   blamed,  however,  for
Campbell's  viciousness in  radio propaganda.  After all,  he was
chosen  because  of  his  theatre  training  and  place in German
society.  They knew  he was  a "ham"  and would  love to play the
part of a war heronazi radio staramerican spy.
        By  instructing Campbell  to work  his way  up the German
chain  of command,  they gave  him permission  to be  a Nazi,  to
perform and serve  ideas that are inherently evil  in the name of
good. As  an American spy, Campbell  had a license to  do and say
evil things, yet  still be able to claim that  he was an agent of
good. This concept is what allowed Campbell to justify taking his
character so  far. He was  a good  spy,  but at the  same time he
promoted the enemy too well.  His father-in-law reflected on this
point after the war:

           "And  do you  know why  I don't  care now  if you were
     a spy or  not?.... Because you  could never have  served the
     enemy as well  as you served us," he  said. "I realized that
     almost all the ideas that I hold now, that make me unashamed
     of anything I may have felt or done as a nazi, came not from
     Hitler, not  from Goebbels, not from  Himmler- but from you.
     You  alone kept  me from  concluding that  Germany had  gone
     insane." (p.80)

        Despite the  fact that the government  is responsible for
turning Campbell into a Nazi,  it takes no responsibility for the
extreme zest with which Campbell performed his duties. So vicious
was Campbell that even Frank Wirtanen, the man who recruited him,
denounces his acts after the war:

           "How many people knew what I was doing?" I said.
           "Three of us," he said.
           "Three people  in the world  knew me for  what I was-"
     I said. "And all the rest-" I shrugged.
           "They  knew  you  for  what  you  were,  too," he said
     abruptly.
           "That wasn't me," I said, startled by his sharpness.
           "Whoever he  was-" said Wirtanen,  "he was one  of the
     most vicious sons of bitches who ever lived." (p.138)

        This leads  us to Campbell's next  period of degradation.
He realizes  that ultimately he must  take responsibility for his
acts, simply  because no one else  will. The government's refusal
to even acknowledge, much less  absolve, Campbell forces him into
a world of guilt and self loathing. He hates himself for becoming
a man  that he  is not,  and yet  must be,  for it  is who he has
become.
        The government's  destruction of Campbell as  a person is
two-fold.  They first  destroy his  reputation and  then his self
image. In doing this, Vonnegut  makes an interesting point. If we
are perceived  as a certain way  by everyone around us,  and then
perceived ourselves this way,  this perception inevitably becomes
a reality. This point is made by Vonnegut in the opening lines of
the introduction of the novel,  where he provides the reader with
a moral:

           This  is the  only story  of mine  whose moral I know.
     I don't  think it's  a marvelous  moral; I  simply happen to
     know what it is: We are what we pretend to be, so we must be
     careful about what we pretend to be. (p.v)

        There is no  villain in <u>Mother Night</u>. It  is the story of
moral dilemma,  a self-involved blind  fight between God  and the
devil.
     Campbell  completely  personifies  everything  we  love  and
everything we  hate about humanity.  A walking paradox,  Campbell
does evil thing in the name of good, all the right things for the
wrong reasons and visa versa. He is  a lover of art and truth and
beauty,  yet so  oblivious to  the ugliness  he creates until the
impact is already so strong it destroys his life.
        Vonnegut presents  Campbell as a  very complex character.
He  is  two  equal  sides;  one  appealing  and  attractive,  one
inherently vile, both relatable.  The two sides are complementary
and make  Campbell a real  person. Most interesting,  however, is
that despite  Campbell's vile side  and evil acts  and words, the
reader  is led  to believe  that Campbell  is a  good person  who
generally hates nazis and their  ignorance. He is portrayed as an
intelligent, likable person who is fully aware of, and completely
remorseful for, his crimes. This leads  the reader to a much more
sympathetic view of Campbell.
        One scene  in which this  is shown is  in Chapter 13,  an
entire  chapter dedicated  to  the  biography of  Reverend Doctor
Lionel Jones.  I will discuss this  chapter and it's implications
to  the novel  later, but  it is  important to examine Campbell's
disclaimer at the end of the chapter. He says:

           Why should  I have honored him  with such a full-dress
     biography? In  order to contrast  myself with a  race-baiter
     who  is  ignorant  and  insane.  I  am  neither ignorant nor
     insane. Those whose orders I  carried out in Germany were as
     ignorant and  insane as Dr. Jones.  I knew it. God  help me,
     I carried out their instructions anyway. (p.61)

        Another scene that shows Campbell's contempt for Nazis
is the eulogy he gives for  August Krapptauer, a Nazi who died in
Campbell's service.

           I  delivered my  eulogy of  August Krapptauer, saying,
     incidentally, what I pretty  much believe, that Krapptauer's
     sort  of truth  would probably  be with  mankind forever, as
     long  as there  were men  and women  around who  listened to
     their heart instead of their minds. (p.133)

        Vonnegut uses the speech as  a double entendre; the Nazis
believe it is  a compliment to August Krapptauer,  yet the reader
knows that it is a statement against racism.
        Vonnegut's  strongest  statement  against  the  idiocy of
bigotry  and  racism  in  <u>Mother  Night</u>  is  the  way in which he
portrays  the post-war  Nazis,  especially  the entourage  of the
Reverend Doctor Jones. Jones himself  is perhaps the most idiotic
character in the novel, as shown in his biography in Chapter 13.
        Jones  began as  a dentist  but was  kicked out of dental
school  because all  of his  papers, regardless  of the  subject,
related  to  his  thesis  that  the  teeth  of  blacks, Jews, and
Catholics  proved that  they were  unequal. He  published a  book
entitled  Jesus Was  Not a  Jew and  started a  newspaper for the
advancement of his hateful  rhetoric. Though Vonnegut shows Jones
as  Campbell's only  true friend   in the  novel, the  only major
character  that at  some point  does not  betray Campbell,  he is
nonetheless portrayed as a hopeless  idiot whose bigotry is based
on nothing.
        Jones' entourage shows the  true contradiction of racism.
His best friend  is a Catholic and his bodyguard  is a black man.
Father  Patrick Keeley  was a  Paulist priest  kicked out  of the
priesthood for delivering sermons about the evil of the Jews.
        Most ridiculous, however, is Robert Sterling Wilson, "The
Black  Fuhrer of  Harlem." Wilson  is a  black man  who served as
a Japanese  spy during  the war.  His presence  among Jones' clan
alone is enough to demonstrate the contradictory and elusive mind
of a bigot. His words, however, demonstrate this even further:

           "The  colored people  are gonna  rise up  in righteous
     wrath, and  they're gonna take over  the world...The colored
     people gonna  have hydrogen bombs  all their own,"  he said.
     "They workin  on it right  now. Pretty soon  gonna be Japans
     turn to drop  one. The rest of the  colored folks gonna give
     them the honor of dropping the first one."
           "Where they going to drop it?" I said.
           "China, most likely," he said.
           "On other colored people?" I said.
           He  looked  at  me   pityingly.  "Who  ever  told  you
     a Chinaman was a colored man?" he said. (p.74)

        <u>Mother  Night</u>  is  a  complex  novel  and cannot be fully
discussed in  a paper of  this length. A  more traditional medium
for Vonnegut is science fiction,  and the themes of government as
a destructive  force  to  individuals,  as  apparent in <u>Mother Night</u>,
can also be seen in these works.
        One of Vonnegut's best techniques in his stories is using
the  future  as  a  setting  to  demonstrate  where  our world is
heading.  <u>Welcome   to  the  Monkey   House</u>,  Vonnegut's  popular
collection of short stories, contains two such stories. They warn
of the dangers  of a government with too much  power and show how
these powers can corrupt good men.
        The title story of <u>Welcome to  the Monkey House</u> is set in
a futuristic America  with vast overpopulation.  In an effort  to
solve the population problem,  the government required that every
citizen  take pills  that made   them numb  from the  waist down,
taking all  pleasure out of sex.  People who refused to  take the
pills were considered outlaws and termed "nothing heads."
        Suicide  was  not  only  legal,  but  encouraged, in this
world.  The  story  began  in  an  Ethical  Suicide Parlor, where
beautiful  virgins,  called  suicide  hostesses, would painlessly
kill you. The hostess were  warned that an infamous nothing head,
Billy  the  Poet,  was  headed  into  town.  Billy  was known for
kidnapping beautiful suicide hostesses and deflowering them.
        Nancy,  one of  the suicide  hostesses, received  a dirty
poem from Billy and was soon  swept away at gunpoint and taken to
Billy's hideout,  a nothing head  haven filled with  devirginized
suicide hostesses. Billy rapes Nancy very systematically, then he
begins to cry.
        Nancy was infuriated, but Billy  assures her that this is
a normal reaction,  but that, with  time, she will  thank him. He
says:

           "I  have spent  this night,  and many  others like it,
     attempting to restore a  certain amount of innocent pleasure
     to the world,  which is poorer in pleasure  than it needs to
     be." (<u>Welcome to the Monkey House</u>, p. 46)

        Vonnegut  portrays Billy  the Poet  as an  evil hero. His
motives are doubtlessly good, yet  no one can condone the methods
that he uses.  Billy plight is not to create  a sexual harem, but
to open the  eyes of people who have been  deceived for too long.
The harshness of his actions must  be accepted as the only way to
accomplish  his mission.  Nancy has  been controlled  for so long
that she  cannot understand the  injustice that is  being done to
her by the government.

           "The world can't afford sex anymore." (Nancy said)
           "Of  course it  can afford  sex," said  Billy. "All it
     can't afford anymore is reproduction."
           "Then why the laws?"
           "They're  bad  laws,"  said  Billy.  "If  you  go back
     through history, you'll find that  people who have been most
     eager to rule, to make  the laws- those people have forgiven
     themselves  and their  friends for  anything and everything.
     But they have been absolutely disgusted and terrified by the
     natural sexuality of common men  and women." (<u>Welcome to the
     Monkey House</u>, p. 45, 46)

        This serves not only as the point of this story, but also
as  a strong  statement by  Vonnegut, revealing  his thoughts  on
traditional government.
        One  point to  be made  when discussing  "Welcome to  the
Monkey   House"  is   Vonnegut's  belief,   and  assertion,  that
government has  no place in  choosing individuals' moral  values.
This point is most strongly made here:
        The pills were ethical because they didn't interfere
with a persons ability to reproduce, which would have been
unnatural and immoral.  All the pills did was take every bit of
pleasure out of sex.  Thus did science and morals go hand in
hand. (<u>Welcome to the Monkey House</u>, p. 29)
        This passage contains strong  hints of sarcasm, and prove
that Vonnegut  believes that science  and government should  stay
out of our personal lives and out of our minds.
        While  Billy  contained  all  the  tradition  elements of
a villain  in this  story, he  was doubtlessly  the hero.  Again,
Vonnegut's main character is composed of two complementary sides;
one  good, and  one evil;  together forming  the whole person. We
must  view Billy,  however, as  essentially good  in order to see
Vonnegut's  point;  that  government  with  this  type  of  moral
stronghold on society is essentially  bad and will force good men
to perform evil acts in the name of freedom.
        This theme is carried into  another story from <u>Welcome to
the Monkey House</u>, entitled  "Harrison Bergeron." This story, only
seven  pages  long,  was  expanded  into  a  movie because of the
interesting questions it raises.
        "Harrison Bergeron" is the story of a futuristic world in
which  everyone is  equal. The  government regulated  everything,
from intelligence  to strength to beauty,  and handicapped people
appropriately. The  purpose was to create  a completely "average"
world devoid of envy.
        The  strong were  forced to  wear bags  filled with  lead
balls,  beautiful   people  wore  ugly  masks,   and  the  overly
intelligent  were constantly  bombarded with  horrible sounds  in
their ear to scramble their thoughts. Harrison Bergeron was a god
in this average  world. He was huge, athletic,  good looking, and
a genus.  The  "Handicapper  General,"  who  was  responsible for
regulating  handicaps,  could  not  come  up  with obstacles fast
enough to hold Harrison.
        One day Harrison took  control of the television station,
an  average  station  with   boring  programs,  and  removed  his
handicaps. He played beautiful music  for the people, showed them
a beautiful woman,  and ballet danced  without his handicaps.  He
was shot and  killed. The result of his  actions were nothing, as
the government sent out excruciating  sounds to scramble the mind
of viewers and make them forget.
        "Harrison  Bergeron" is  short and  to the  point, a near
embodiment  of my  thesis. Harrison  can be  seen as  an absolute
hero,  destroyed by  corrupt government  forces. Harrison's  only
crime  was  taking  control  of  the  television  studio, but his
motives outweighed the crime. He  was shot for exposing the world
to beauty.
        The  reason that  we see  Harrison as  a hero is twofold.
First, we naturally know that this  is a government with too much
power. No matter what our political views, it is inherently wrong
to  suppress  a  persons  natural  talent  and  ability.  Second,
Vonnegut shows us the flaws of  this world in the story, both the
flaws of the philosophy and the flaws of an average society.
        The flaws of this philosophy are shown in this passage:

           "...and  pretty soon  we'd be  right back  to the dark
     ages again, with everybody competing against everybody else.
     You wouldn't like that would you?"
           "I'd hate it," said Hazel.
           "There you are," said George. "The minute people start
     cheating on laws, what do you think happens to society?"
           If Hazel hadn't been able to come up with an answer to
     this question,  George couldn't have  supplied one. A  siren
     was going off in his head.
           "Reckon it'd fall all apart," said Hazel.
           "What  would?" said  George blankly.  (<u>Welcome to  the
     Monkey House</u>, p. 9)

        The flaw of the philosophy is shown through the inability
to truly think about it.  George, Harrison's father, is described
as  a  man  of  above  average  intelligence.  Still,  his mental
handicap is so strong that he cannot think straight for more than
a few minutes. Therefore, it's impossible for people like George,
capable of seeing the evil in  an average society, to think about
it long enough to discover the injustice being preformed.
        Vonnegut also shows us the  flaws of the average society.
So dull and mundane is this culture that no one excels and no one
fails.  Imagine if  you could  do everything  as well as everyone
else, and visa versa.
        The  television  program  was  suddenly  interrupted  for
a news bulletin. It wasn't clear at first as to what the bulletin
was  about,  since  the   announcer,  like  all  announcers,  had
a serious  speech impediment.  For about  half a  minute, and  in
a state of  high excitement, the announcer  tried to say, "Ladies
and Gentlemen-"

           He finally gave up, handed the bulletin to a ballerina
     to read. (<u>Welcome to the Monkey House</u>, p. 10)

        The flaw  of the average world  is that no one  can truly
enjoy  doing  or  watching  anything.  There  is  no  pleasure in
watching someone do something you could easily accomplish, and no
pleasure  in  doing  something  that  can  easily  be done by the
masses.  Not only  is enjoyment  hampered, but  art is destroyed.
Expression  of  complex  ideas  and  concepts  is  impossible  in
a mundane  society,  such  as  the  one  described  in  "Harrison
Bergeron."
        Kurt  Vonnegut's works  can be  enjoyed on  a variety  of
levels.   His  novels   are  well   constructed,  prophetic,  and
entertaining. The  recurrent themes of  government corruption and
repression in his  novels would leave the reader  to believe that
Vonnegut  does not  trust ruling   factions. He  warns us  of the
dangers of too much government  power and control of our personal
lives.
