<b><u>Chance and Fate</b></u>
    "Among  the things  Billy Pilgrim  could not  change were  the
past, the present, and the future"  (SF 60). In one sentence, this
is Vonnegut's view of humankind's  free will: Since all moments in
time exist simultaneously, how can we change any one of them?
    Vonnegut  goes to  great lengths  to make  this point, playing
with the semantics of the question,  but always coming to the same
conclusion.  The question  of "Why  me?" is  often asked (SF 76-7,
91; BC 44), with the answer being  there is no answer, it just is.
Vonnegut also likes to declare that  we have no choice in matters,
that we can't  change a thing (SF 117, 151,  154, 207, 210; BC 32,
103; S 56; J 60, 87, 158).
    These  two  views  not  only  tie  in  nicely  with Vonnegut's
perception of  time, but they  also coordinate well  with his view
that nobody is ridiculous, bad, or  disgusting (SF 8), for how can
a person be bad if that person  has no say over the past, present,
or future? We are rendered neutral being (SF 198), mere robots, in
essence,  which  is  one  of  the  major  themes  of  Breakfast of
Champions (3).
    Yet, afloat in  the midst of all these  assertions that we are
trapped in amber, Vonnegut does not completely declare that chance
- free will - is out of the question. In Breakfast of Champions he
insinuates that free will is something we maybe once had as a race
or all had as individuals, but  we gave it away to a manifestation
of God,  or God took  it away and  we could get  it back from  God
should  we want  it back,  which we  don't (73),  or should She/He
decide to give it back (295).
    Two  other comments  Vonnegut makes  leave open  the door that
might  allow in  free will/chance.  The first  occurs in Slapstick
when he is recalling Alice, his  sister. Alice never saw her awful
luck as being anything other than  accidents in a very busy place.
To this, Vonnegut writes, "Good for  her" (13). Then, near the end
of Jailbird, Starbuck realizes that  if the chess- playing machine
he received  as an old  man had been  invented when he  was a kid,
then Alexander  Hamilton McCone would  never have needed  to start
playing  games with  the young  Starbuck, so  Starbuck would never
have gone to Harvard, and his  life would have been very different
(278).
    While  Vonnegut  does  leave   the  door  open,  his  numerous
references to the  question of "Why?", and the  statements that we
have no choice,  reveal that he is a believer  in a definite Fate.
However, Vonnegut is  wise enough to realize that  he doesn't have
all the answers, and that should he receive enough evidence on the
side of Chance, he would have no trouble believing in it.

<b><u>Religion</b></u>
    Vonnegut grew  up in an  atheistic family, but  even though he
isn't  religious, he  sees religions  as being  good in  that they
provide comforting little lies for people, and an extended family,
too (J 80).
    Vonnegut establishes his non-belief in a supreme deity through
Billy Pilgrim. The crucifix that hung  on the wall in Billy's room
when he was a child represented a  dead man, and that dead man was
Billy's Christ  (SF 38). God is  personal; he is whoever  you want
her to be (J 73, 77).
    One  of Vonnegut's  complaints  with  Christianity is  that it
teaches its followers to be so cruel. When Kilgore Trout wrote The
Gospel  from Outer  Space, the  conclusion the  visitor from outer
space reached about what the  Gospels taught was this: "Before you
kill somebody,  make absolutely sure he  isn't well connected" (SF
109). By the time of the  writing of Jailbird, Vonnegut has become
even more appalled by the Gospel, for in it is this line: "'Depart
from me, you cursed, into the  eternal fire prepared for the devil
and his angels.'" These words  "are surely the inspiration for the
notorious  cruelty  of  Christians"  (81).  If  nothing  else, the
Creator  of the  Universe has  a weird,  if not  twisted, sense of
humor (BC 160).
    In Slaughterhouse-Five, Kilgore Trout  blesses us with a brief
little speech  that satirizes Christianity. In  this speech, Trout
tells a  fellow guest at Billy  and Valencia Pilgrim's anniversary
party that God listens to everything she says, and is writing down
everything she  does. On Judgement Day,  Trout continues, God goes
over all  the things she  said and did,  and if it  turns out that
they're  bad things  instead of  good things,  that's too bad, for
she'll burn  forever and ever,  and the pain  of the burning  will
never  stop. The  lady he  tells this  to turns  gray and  becomes
petrified.  She  believes  Trout.  Trout  laughs  so  hard  at her
ignorance that  a salmon egg flies  out of his mouth  and lands in
her  cleavage (172).  The reason  Trout finds  this so  amusing is
because he knows  that religion is merely a  tool for manipulating
the world (202).
    One of  the major religious  themes of Slapstick  and Jailbird
deals  with the  use of  and  need  for rituals  in religion.  The
previously mentioned  pages of Slapstick (44,  204) that deal with
the comforts  of rituals in general  can easily be applied  to the
sacraments  and prayers  that  are  constantly repeated  in church
services. Part of the allure of these rituals is that they free us
from having  to think (J 25),  which is always a  comfort, because
it's impossible to fail then (make the wrong decision).
    Another way in which religion keeps us from having to think is
by  establishing a  doctrine for   its followers  that is  easy to
understand.  The Christian  Bible says  not to  kill, and for most
Christians, this  isn't hard to understand.  If a Christian should
become very  upset with someone and  be contemplating killing this
person, they  need only to  remember the Sixth  Commandment, "Thou
shalt not kill."  Their misery over deciding whether  to kill this
person or not is over; God has given them the answer. Now they can
relax and be happy, for they have nothing to talk about again. For
Arpad  Leen, his  happiness was  the religion  of working for Mary
Kathleen  O'Looney, Mrs.  Jack Graham,  the owner  of RAMJAC. Mary
Kathleen gave Arpad very explicit directions, and he merely had to
carry them out. This was easy.  This was happiness for Arpad Leen.
"All happiness is religious" (J 238).
    An  outstanding analysis  that Vonnegut  makes of  religion is
that religious  people need to  have a living  deity, one that  is
alive and able to control them,  so they don't have to think. Mary
Kathleen and  Arpad Leen are used  as examples again to  make this
point. Arpad,  like everyone other  than Walter Starbuck,  doesn't
know, for approximately two years,  that Mary Kathleen is dead. So
he  goes on  worshipping her,  following her  orders to "'acquire,
acquire,  acquire'" as  he always  had before  (J 270). When Arpad
finds out that Mary Kathleen is dead, he has only one option: Find
another deity to  serve (271). This, Vonnegut knows,  is just like
Christianity.  Jesus had  to rise  from the  dead, or his religion
would  have been  no good.  Since he  is still  alive, he is still
calling  the  shots,  still  in  charge,  making decisions for his
followers. This leads to a  very shallow faith, because Christians
are always merely  doing what the Bible tells them  to do, or what
other  Christians  tell  them  the  Bible  is  telling  them to do
(J 71). No thought, questioning, or enlightenment is involved.
    Only in Slapstick does Vonnegut give a detailed perspective of
what he  thinks the afterlife  is like, and  he gives his  opinion
many times  throughout the novel. He  gives it early in  the novel
(60), and he gives it late (234). He gives it in between (143). He
lets the reader know that the afterlife is boring, boring, boring;
it  is  infinitely  more  tiresome  than  the life we're currently
living  (85). Vonnegut  has cut  between the  paths to  Heaven and
Hell, establishing an afterlife that more resembles a drab nursing
home.
    The appearance in Slapstick of  the Church of Jesus Christ the
Kidnapped  is a  playful mockery  of the  bizarre qualities of all
religions  (185). The  followers of  this religion  are constantly
looking  behind  chairs  and  under  plates  and  glasses  for the
kidnapped  Jesus. The  absurd ritual  of constantly  jerking one's
head  about to  try to  catch a  glimpse of  the missing savior is
really  no preposterous  than the  drinking of  the Christ's blood
every week in Catholic and Lutheran church services.
    A major  problem Vonnegut has  with the Christian  religion is
how  Christians  like  to  focus  on  the  hell-fire  of  the  New
Testament, and ignore the Sermon on  the Mount. In the prologue of
Jailbird, Vonnegut  recounts a lunch encounter  he had with Powers
Hapgood, a Harvard  man who dedicated his life  to helping working
people get their fair share.  Hapgood had spent the morning before
the  lunch  on  the  witness   stand  telling  stories  about  his
adventures as part  of labor history. When the  judge asks him why
he, a man with such a fine education and from such a distinguished
family,  does  what  he  does,  Hapgood  answers, "'Because of the
Sermon  on the  Mount, sir'"  (19). Vonnegut  can't understand why
more Christians  don't take this  approach to life.  The Sacco and
Vanzetti case, one of the  greatest miscarriages of justice in our
country's history, is  an example of this (J  21). All they wanted
was for  everybody to have food  and a place to  live, and it cost
them their lives. This country of ours, which so many politicians,
especially conservative politicians, want to turn into, basically,
a Christian  state (i.e.,  reinstitute prayer  in public  schools,
make  abortions  illegal,  teach  creationism  in science classes,
etc.), totally ignores the teachings  of Christ that don't support
their agenda,  such as the Sermon  on the Mount and  Jesus telling
the rich young  man that to attain eternal life  the young man had
to  sell all  he had  and  give  that money  to the  poor (Matthew
19:16-30).  But like  the rich  young man,  the rich, conservative
politicians of our country will never change our capitalist system
in favor  of the socialism  that Jesus taught  (J 59). For  though
there were no limits to Jesus's charity, the Christians with money
in  the United  States, and  most of  the rest  of the world, have
strict limits to their charitable giving (J 189, 190).

<b><u>Politics and History</b></u>
    Through the voice of Walter Starbuck, Vonnegut admits to being
a socialist, to the extent that all people should have their basic
needs  taken  care  of,  that  all  armies and national boundaries
should be abolished, and the  Family of Man should be established.
"The only  people who would be  excluded from such a  friendly and
merciful society would be one who  took more wealth than he or she
needed  at any  time" (J   57). Socialism  can work;  Vonnegut has
personally seen it work (SF 70). However, he realizes that it will
be nearly impossible for socialism  to become a world-wide reality
due to the  greed of wealthy people who don't  want to share their
wealth (BC 13). All the while  these rich people, many of whom are
politicians,  complain  about  the  rising  crime  rates  and  the
incredible  amount  of  drug  usage  in  this country, while never
allowing themselves to see or admit  that crime and drug usage are
the result of the uneven distribution of wealth (BC 70-1).
    The United  States has committed great  sins - greed, slavery,
genocide, criminal neglect (BC 293).  We have wiped out the Native
Americans as a  political policy (J 27). Vonnegut's  point is that
we  are all  guilty of  these atrocities,  though some people more
than  others. His  blanket refutation  of the  Great Man Theory of
history (S 224; J 278), and his assertion that all politicians are
the same - they're enthusiastic chimpanzees (BC 88) - is enough to
show that we are all at least somewhat culpable for the atrocities
that  have been  committed, for  we are  the ones  who have either
supported the chimpanzees in their  policies, or have too silently
protested them. In  fact, many of us are  Fascists because we have
made  the nation  sacred (BC  180). However,  many of the problems
that  confront us  today can  be traced  back to  the enthusiastic
chimpanzees that were writers of the Constitution, who established
the  precedent of  political disenfranchisement  based on  wealth,
connections, and color  (S 53). This allowed a  few rich white men
to set themselves  up as the procurers of  this country, to debate
hypocritically about  the welfare of  all mankind (S  157). One of
the  great  accomplishments  of  the  government issued artificial
extended  families of  Slapstick is  that it  allowed democracy to
work, for democracy can really only work and flourish if it's kept
small-scale (215).
    Jailbird is  the most political  of the four  novels. It takes
only until  the third paragraph of  the book for Vonnegut  to show
his contempt for  the government, which stems all  the way back to
the way the FBI executed John Dillinger (9). From here he moves on
to make the point that governments,  usually on the state or local
level,  will  willingly  make  laws   that  are  contrary  to  the
Constitution  if the  law will  benefit big  business, which is to
say, themselves  (30). Politicians make  these laws, not  only for
their own  financial benefit, but  because they feel  they have to
control everybody, and because they feel they know what's best for
us (63).
    One of the  major problems with governments is  that they are,
of necessity,  Ponzi schemes; that is,  they accept enormous loans
they  know they  will never  repay (94).  Of course,  that doesn't
matter to the politicians, because they skim money from the loans,
and/or  benefit  business-wise  from  the  capitalism  these loans
support, and  they are not held  personally accountable for paying
back the loans.  Amazing. The humorous thing about  all of this is
that we keep  electing presidents to run the  country, when we all
know our  government is so out  of control that the  president can
only pretend to be in charge (132).

<b><u>The Environment</b></u>
    At the time of the  writing of Jailbird, politicians cared not
at all about the environment because it wasn't an issue that would
help  them get  elected (46).  While this  has changed  to a small
degree,  the environment  is still  largely being  ignored by  the
oligarchy  that is  at the  head of  our country. The environment,
meanwhile, continues to get worse.
    In Slaughterhouse-Five  Vonnegut shows how we  continue to pay
for wars environmentally even decades  after they have ended (39),
yet the environmental cost of a war is seldom, if ever, taken into
consideration when world leaders decide to exercise their egos. An
excellent  example of  this was  the pointless  chaos known as the
Persian Gulf Crisis.
    The  ways   and  reasons  of   environmental  destruction  are
numerous. The effect of that  most worshipped of all entities, the
automobile,  is that,  eventually, everything  will be  wiped out,
despite  anything anyone  can do  (BC 29,  30). So the environment
will continue to get steadily worse, until we become a planet that
eats petroleum and  coal (BC 59-61). Why will  our planet continue
to get worse? Because we  sacrifice the planet for worthless goods
like soda and work day products  (BC 84), and on products that are
used just  to demonstrate how rich  and clever we are  (J 99). The
environment  will not  only continue  to get  worse because of our
greedy,  lustful ways  (S 28),  but also  because most  people are
utterly apathetic to global  destruction, even when it's happening
all around them (BC 125). The bottom line is that when the land is
destroyed, the people are destroyed right along with it (BC 126).
    We  continue to  pollute without  conscience, yielding  absurd
results (J 169), and yet, we  don't learn from our mistakes; we'll
keep  abusing  the  planet  until  it  can  no  longer  support us
(S 225-6).

<b><u>Facades</b></u>
    Facades are  public relations at  all levels, and  much of the
material success of people, others' perceptions of people, and the
wants of people,  are based, not on knowledge,  wisdom, hard work,
honesty,  or understanding,  but on  facades. This  is a recurring
theme in Slaughterhouse-Five (50, 58, 94, 188, 190).
    Why are  facades so successful  and prevalent? Simply  because
people  enjoy them  so much  (SF 103).  When we  allow images  and
illusions to  color the way we  perceive a person, it  makes it so
much easier to decide if we like  the person or not (SF 168, 185).
We no longer have to think; the person presenting the facade makes
the decision for us that we should like and/or respect him or her.
    The  only real  mention of  facades in  Breakfast of Champions
occurs in relation to the  business world and Kilgore Trout. Trout
is  making his  living at  the time  as an  installer of  aluminum
combination  storm windows  and screens.  Trout has  nothing to do
with the sales end of the business because he has no charm. Charm,
which  is  another  name  for  public  relations,  is a scheme for
getting strangers to immediately like  and trust a person (BC 20).
In other  words, a way to  allow people to not  have to think; the
person  merely  takes  the   salesperson's  advice  and  purchases
whatever the salesperson  wants them to. The fact  is, people want
to be  lied to because  it exonerates them  of all blame  (S 141).
They  know  that  should  anything  eventually  go  wrong, such as
finding out  they spent too  much money on  the product or  bought
a bad  product,  they  can  always  thrust  the  blame back on the
salesperson. The same applies to  politicians and doctors. We just
love our facades.
    The  other two  types of  facades mentioned  in Slapstick deal
with beauty and substance. As  for beauty, Eliza decides that it's
overrated when she says the story  of the ugly duckling would have
been  much better  if the  duckling had  turned into  a rhinoceros
instead  of a  swan (58).  The young  Wilbur and  Eliza, living in
their own world, couldn't conceive  of beauty being important. But
in  our  society,  a  person  can  be  utterly  without talent and
intelligence, yet, if she or he  is beautiful, they will be looked
upon as a  star, lavished with money and  attention, and looked to
for  their opinion.  Why is  this,  when  beauty is  so silly  and
trivial (J 142-3)?
    The  other type  of facade  involves the  public relations  of
coming across  as an expert (S  90). There are too  many people on
this planet who may have the  education and knowledge in a certain
field to be considered an expert in their area, and are considered
an  expert by  most people,   but they  are malicious  lunatics in
actuality. This may be due  to personal shortcomings, jealousy, or
greed,  making them  horrible people;  yet, they  are treated with
reverence and  respect by nearly everybody,  simply because of the
facade they have established and maintained.
    Public relations, in  its many forms, convinces us  of what we
want to hear  (J 113). Whether it's a  public relations firm hired
by Kuwait to make a child lie  to the U.S. public to gain military
support, or  a fashion model's  manager telling us  that the model
cares  deeply for  AIDS victims,  it all  comes down  to the  same
thing: They're doing  our thinking for us. We  don't have to think
about if starting a war is right when a public relations firm gets
a little  girl to  go on  national  TV  and lie  to us  that Iraqi
soldiers are  throwing newborns out  of their incubators  and onto
the floor  to their death. This  firm has just told  us a war with
Iraq is just, so it must be. Joe Average just had his mind made up
for him and doesn't have to think about the situation any more. We
don't have to think about whether we like the model or not because
it's obvious we should because  she's intelligent (she knows about
the  horror  of  AIDS)  and  compassionate  (she  cares about AIDS
victims). Her manager has decided for us that we like her.
    Vonnegut is aware of the power of public relations, due to his
work with General Electric, and the  prevalence of it. He shows it
to us  in the bold  strokes he paints  for us of  the decrepit bag
lady  that  is  Mary  Kathleen  O'Looney,  who  looks  and  smells
disgusting, yet has  the soul of a fiery renegade  (J 195), and in
the  soft  nuances  of  Walter  F.  Starbuck,  whose tailored suit
renders him a counterfeit of a perfect gentleman (J 264).

<b><u>Women, Prejudice, and Metaphysics</b></u>
    One  of the  more  interesting  subjects that  Vonnegut writes
about in  these novels is women.  He treats them as  the intricate
beings they are.
    In Slaughterhouse-Five he confines  his comments about them to
the  statement  that  associating  sex  and  glamor  with  war  is
"a simple-minded thing  for a female Earthling to  do" (121). This
is  not  a  blanket  condemnation  of  women,  as  many people may
perceive it; rather,  it is a condemnation of  our entire society,
that  we  should  have  evolved  to  the  point  that we associate
violence with sex. This statement is as much a condemnation of men
as women.
    Being  as   Breakfast  of  Champions   came  out  just   after
Vonnegut's separation  from his first  wife, it should  come as no
surprise that he should treat women  with some wrath in this book.
He also treats  them with empathy. His first  foray into the world
of  women   in  Breakfast  of  Champions   is  neither  harsh  nor
complimentary; it's a mere statement  of fact. Vonnegut points out
that many women are intelligent enough  to be stupid as a survival
technique  (136).  He  follows  this  up  with  showing  how women
oftentimes  marry for  money rather  than love  (143). Could it be
because  they won't  have to  think as  much? However, through the
Kentucky Fried Chicken incident, Vonnegut shows how some women are
selfless and only want what's best for their man (156-160).
    Where  does this  bring us  to? To  Vonnegut's assertion  that
women are  "more spiritual, more  sacred than women"  (J 53). Yet,
women don't want love, they want power and money (J 132). Vonnegut
knows  that  all  living  creatures  are  many-faceted. Especially
women.
    Prejudice  is another  topic  Vonnegut  deals with,  mainly in
Breakfast of Champions. He notes  that the sea pirates who arrived
on this continent were prejudiced.  The people who were already on
this  continent, and  were slaughtered  by the  white sea pirates,
were copper-colored.  The slaves the  sea pirates brought  to this
continent  were black.  "Color  was  everything" (11).  While this
seems barbaric, racism is still an  ugly part of our society (72).
Vonnegut  conjectures that  one of  the reasons  for the continued
racism  in our  country has  to do  with the  Civil War. The white
people in the North, who won the war, were frustrated because they
lost so  many lives, yet  received no spoils  from the war.  Their
descendants inherited that frustration,  without ever knowing what
it  was  (246).  This  is   a  very  viable  explanation  for  the
continuation  of racism,  for it  seems that  this frustration has
snuck into the collective unconscious  of white people and refuses
to get out.
    Another form of prejudice that  is prevalent in our society is
that  prejudice  that  is  leveled  against  the artisitic and the
intelligent.  Vonnegut shows  the prejudice  towards the  artistic
through the characters of Harry  and Grace LeSabre in Breakfast of
Champions.  It  appears  they  may  be  the only sexually creative
people in all of Midland City.  They keep their sexual artistry to
themselves,  though,  because  they  know  that  no one else would
understand  them. Their  frustration at  having to  keep their art
secret finally leads  them to leave Midland City  and move to Maui
(164).
    It is  through a Kilgore  Trout story that  the ostracizing of
the intelligent is  shown. In this story, a  female rabbit has the
intelligence  of  Albert  Einstein.  The  sad  thing is, she leads
a fairly  normal  female  rabbit's  life,  and  comes  to view her
intelligence as a useless tumor (BC 232). She is never able to use
the greatest  blessing of her life,  for if she used  it, it would
have  set her  outside the  scope of  the world  she was  in -  an
unapproachable mutant to the other rabbits.
    Vonnegut  also  uses  the  case   of  Sacco  and  Vanzetti  to
illuminate  two  other  forms  of  prejudice,  and  those  are the
prejudices leveled against foreigners and common sense. The common
sense of  Sacco and Vanzetti  came from the  same books that  were
studied by Harvard men, but  somehow the Harvard men never learned
from them. Sacco and Vanzetti's  common sense was that governments
are the  enemies of the  people, and that  many of the  people who
make up  our government are unjust,  self-deceiving, ignorant, and
greedy. Such common sense is  grounds enough for being ostracized,
even murdered, but add into the  equation that the holders of this
common  sense were  foreign born,  and it  comes as  no shock that
these two men were sacrificed (J 216).
    One  final  topic  that  Vonnegut  briefly  touches  on is the
metaphysical. He mentions it in  Breakfast of Champions in regards
to  the death  of Mary  Young. Upon  her death  she sent out small
telepathic  butterflies to  everyone she  had known,  of which was
Dwayne Hoover, who hears her last words. He doesn't know where the
voice  came from  (63-4). Then  twice in  Slapstick Vonnegut makes
a reference  to  people  communicating  by  telepathic  means (94,
100).  What does  it mean?  It means  that Vonnegut  realizes that
there is much out there that we don't understand and must keep our
