<b><u>Death</u></b>

    "And  even if  war didn't  keep coming  like glaciers,  there
would  still  be  plain  old  death"  (SF  4). Such is Vonnegut's
resignation  to the  fact that  this life  will end;  as for what
awaits us after we die, his opinions fluctuate during the span of
these books.  In Slaughterhouse-Five he  treats death as  if it's
little different  from a peaceful  sleep (34), and  he resents it
when someone rescues him from  dying (44), because it's all right
to be  dead (148). By  the time we  get to Slapstick,  Vonnegut's
view has changed  drastically. On three occasions in  the book he
refers  to  the  afterlife  as  being  downright boring (60, 143,
234), and in one instance he goes so far as to say that "the life
that awaits us  is infinitely more tiresome than  this one" (85).
While  specific  mentioning  of  the  afterlife  is  not  made in
Breakfast of Champions, it is most  likely that it was during the
writing  of  it  that  Vonnegut's  views  of  the  afterlife were
changing,  for the  last words  of  the  novel are  cried out  by
Kilgore  Trout: "Make  me young,  make me  young, make me young!"
(295).   Apparently,  Vonnegut   has  stopped,   by  this  point,
perceiving the  afterlife as a  wonderful sleep, and  has started
seeing it as something to be avoided for as long as possible.
    As  we  turn  to  Jailbird,  though,  this  perception of the
afterlife  seems to  have mellowed  a bit.  It starts with Walter
Starbuck surmising that life in general is probably worth it, but
that  it goes  on too  long (200).  It appears  by this time that
Vonnegut  seems  to  be  anticipating,  if  not joyously at least
without any remorse, departing this life for whatever lies ahead.
Later,  though,  Mary  Kathleen  says  that  she  hates  life and
welcomes  death, because  even though  she's one  of the  richest
people in  the world, and she's  done everything she can  to make
the  world better  for  everybody,  she hasn't  accomplished much
because there  isn't much that  anybody can do  - she's tired  of
trying  (257). Mary  Kathleen is   speaking as  the voice  of the
pessimistic Vonnegut,  who often questions  if his writings  have
really  made  a  difference.  But  it  is  also  the voice of the
Vonnegut who doesn't give up, even  though he might not be making
much of a difference, as is evidenced by Vonnegut's later role as
a co-editor  of the  political watchdog  magazine the  Washington
Spectator.


<b><u>People</u></b>

    This  section  will  cover  Vonnegut's  views  on  people  in
general, and also how we  allow other people to determine certain
aspects of our lives, whether  it's from personal interaction, or
from the elite  of this country using various  forms of the media
to shape our thoughts and influence our decisions.
    As was  mentioned earlier, Vonnegut was  taught as a graduate
student  in  anthropology  that  no  one  is  bad, disgusting, or
ridiculous, and this  has had a great effect  on his writing, for
while he  shies away from making  blanket condemnations of people
or organizations, he will make  occasional comments that lead the
reader into viewing certain people and institutions with disdain.
    An  example of  his non-judgemental  approach occurs  when he
mentions  in  Slaughterhouse-Five  about  going  to  the New York
World's Fair. The Ford Motor Car  Company and Walt Disney tell us
what the  past had been like,  and what the future  will be like,
but  not what  the present  is, and  how it  relates to  Vonnegut
(18). In  this brief passage,  Vonnegut has managed  to allow for
the reader to find out for him or herself just how much influence
big  business has  on determining  how we  view the  world, while
pointing out their obvious  shortcomings and inabilities, without
pronouncing any judgements.
    The media/elite go to great  lengths to propagate wars in the
way they use glamorous people to  portray war heroes on TV and in
movies (SF 14-5). If war isn't glorified it won't occur nearly as
often (SF 117). This is bad for the elite class, because they are
the  ones who  benefit financially  from conflict  by owning  the
businesses that produce war goods and machinery, and/or by having
the money to invest in these industries.
    A wonderful comment Vonnegut makes  on people is that so many
of  us in  the United  States are  trying to  construct lives for
ourselves that  make sense by  purchasing things we  find in gift
shops (SF 39). Billy Pilgrim's mother is one of these people, and
from the sketchy details we are given of her, it would be safe to
assume that she led a vacuous life.
    An  aspect of  human nature  that Vonnegut  points out  in an
almost delicate  manner is the self-centeredness  and apathy that
runs rampant among the human race. An incident to illustrate this
assertion comes in 1967 when  Billy is driving through the ghetto
of his  hometown, Ilium. A black  man taps on Billy's  car window
while Billy is stopped at a street  light and acts as if he wants
to talk about  something. While Billy could roll  down the window
and see  what the man wants,  he does the simplest  thing instead
- he drives on  (SF 59). Soon after this, it  is noted that Billy
was not  moved to protest the  bombing of North Vietnam;  he "did
not shudder about the hideous  things he himself had seen bombing
do" (60). Billy had become an uninvolved spectator to life.
    Another  aspect of  human nature  that Vonnegut  deals subtly
with is our  need to fit in and be  accepted. He first touches on
this when he  shows Billy playing hacker's golf  with three other
optometrists. Billy obviously is not  golfing because he is good;
he is golfing because he feels the need to connect with others on
some level (85). Then when Billy goes back to World War II and is
under the influence  of morphine, he dreams he  is a giraffe, and
the other giraffes kiss him and  accept him, simply because he is
one of them (99). Billy  never felt such uncritical acceptance as
a human.
    One of the  problems with people is that  we many times allow
others to determine who we are and what we do. There are a number
of  examples of  this throughout  Slaughterhouse-Five. The  first
example uses a  German shepherd named Princess as  a metaphor for
people and how  the societal machine often takes  over our lives.
Princess had spent her life on a farm until the morning she makes
her appearance  in the book.  That morning she  was borrowed from
the farmer,  and she soon found  herself in a war.  She had never
been to  war before, and had  no idea what game  was being played
(52), just like  many of the soldiers, who,  like Princess, would
rather  have  been  back  home  on  the  farm.  But society is so
unbending, Princess  and the soldiers shouldn't  really expect to
be able to determine their own lives (167). Nor will they be able
to determine  who they are,  because society will  determine that
for them, too (169).
    An  aspect of  being human  that Vonnegut  touches on  rather
nicely  is how  trivial most  of  us  are. As  Billy lies  in the
veterans' hospital after his  emotional breakdown, Valencia talks
only about  their silver pattern  (111). Our lives  are so filled
with  trivialities that  our  existence  becomes mundane,  to the
point  that  Billy  must  confess  to  the Tralfamadorians, after
eating his breakfast out of cans, cleaning the dishes, doing some
exercises, and showering, that he  is as happy on Tralfamadore as
he was  on Earth (113-4),  for Billy's life  on Earth was  merely
bearable, due mainly to his marrying a woman he didn't love so he
would be wealthy.  That Billy's life was so  mundane is borne out
by the  conjecture that the  happiest moment of  Billy's life was
spent  sleeping in  the back  of a  horse-drawn wagon  in Dresden
(195).  The greatest  moment of  his  life  was when  he was  not
conscious of this world.
    In Breakfast of Champions Vonnegut  returns to the thought of
how  mundane  our  lives  are  when   he  tells  of  one  of  the
conversations  that takes  place  between  Kilgore Trout  and the
truck driver.  When the truck driver  finds out that Trout  is in
the  aluminum storm  window  business  and knows  something about
aluminum siding,  he asks Trout  if the people  who have aluminum
siding installed  are happy with  what they get.  Trout says they
are about  the only really  happy people he  ever saw (107).  Can
life be any more vacuous than that?
    Vonnegut levels an attack on  the people of the United States
when he writes  about two incidents that occur  while Billy is in
the POW camp. When Billy gets  snagged in a barbed-wire fence and
can't unsnag himself, a Russian  soldier undoes the snags for him
one  by one.  Billy leaves  without a  word of  thanks while  the
Russian waves  and says, "'Good-bye'"  (SF 123-4). While  we must
bear in mind that Billy is  still under the influence of morphine
in this  instance, Paul Lazzarro  has no such  excuse when he  is
caught stealing a British soldier's cigarettes. After the debacle
of this  and the dinner  and play that  the British POW's  shared
with the  U.S. prisoners, one of  the British soldiers is  led to
comment about  the U.S. soldiers,  "'Weak, smelly, self-  pitying
- a pack of sniveling, dirty,  thieving bastards'" (127). In this
same vein, shortly  after Dresden is bombed Billy  and some other
U.S. soldiers  nearly kill a  horse they had  been using to  pull
a wagon they were in. They paid  as much attention to the horse's
needs  as  they  would  have  paid  to  a six- cylinder Chevrolet
(196),  showing once  again how  the U.S.  can be  such a selfish
society.
    A tremendous  condemnation Vonnegut makes  of our society  is
how we treat the poor people  of our country. He uses a monograph
that is  sent out by  Howard W. Campbell,  the main character  of
Vonnegut's 1962 novel, Mother Night,  to make the point. Campbell
had been born and raised in Schenectady, New York, but had become
a German citizen and worked as a double agent for the U.S. during
World  War II.  His job  for Germany  was in  propaganda, to make
Germany  look  good  to  as  many  people  as  possible.  In  the
monograph, Campbell writes that the U.S. is the wealthiest nation
on Earth, but that its people are  mainly poor, and that it is in
fact a crime to be poor  in the United States. Every other nation
has  folk  tales  and  traditions  about  men  who  were poor but
extremely wise and virtuous; the U.S. has no such traditions. The
motto  for the  U.S. may  as well  be, "If  you're so  smart, why
ain't you rich?", for the most  destructive untruth is that it is
easy for  a person to make  money in the United  States. The rich
propagate this  untruth to keep  the poor down,  for if the  poor
believe this they will constantly blame themselves for being poor
and  exalt  the  rich  for  being  intelligent, hard working, and
virtuous  (SF 128-9).  Don't sign  this monograph  with Howard W.
Campbell's name, sign it with Kurt Vonnegut's.
    Vonnegut makes sure  he shows that people will  do just about
anything  in the  name of  love, and  that we  need to  show more
common   decency   to   one    another,   not   more   love.   In
Slaughterhouse-Five  he shows  how Billy  Pilgrim's daughter uses
love  as  an  excuse  to  take  away  Billy's  dignity  (132). In
Slapstick he suggests that people, when they fight, should say to
each  other, "'Please  - a  little less  love, and  a little more
common decency'" (3).
    The rich people of this country have had a large influence on
how things are done here. One  thing they have influenced is that
we are the  only nation on the planet that  will not dip its flag
to  any person  or thing,  even though  this is  merely a form of
friendly and  respectful salute (BC  9). Since our  flag won't be
dipped  to dignataries  or  institutions  of other  countries, it
should come  as no surprise  that a lot  of the citizens  of this
country,  mainly poor  citizens, should  also be  ignored by  the
rich. But  even worse than  being simply ignored,  they are often
cheated and  insulted, too (9).  The way the  rich people can  so
easily get away  with cheating and insulting the  poor is because
they have managed to utterly  confuse the poor with pictures like
that of  the truncated pyramid  with a radiant  eye on top  of it
that is found on paper money (9-10). The masses are also confused
by our educational system, which really doesn't educate them - it
merely tries to  prepare them to get a job  (J 48). The confusion
begins when  the kids are  in elementary school.  They are taught
that  Columbus  discovered  this   continent  in  1492  when,  in
actuality, there  were millions of human  being already here, and
that 1492 was simply the year when sea pirates began to cheat and
rob and kill  them (BC 10). The children  are further taught that
these sea pirates eventually created a wonderful government which
became a beacon of freedom  to human beings everywhere. They even
set up a  huge statue of an imaginary beacon  to further fool the
mass  of children  (BC 10-1).  When these  children grow up, they
become dazed and confused when they find out for themselves about
1492 and  the imaginary beacon. It  is at this point,  while they
are  confused, that  the rich  people take  advantage of them. In
this country that is a beacon of freedom, the Earthlings that had
a lot of  money didn't think  they should have  to share it  with
others,  unless they  really wanted  to, and  most of them didn't
want to (BC 13).
    Through  the  mouth  of  Kilgore  Trout,  Vonnegut states his
opinion on what  the human race deserves, and  what we deserve is
to die horribly, since we  have behaved so cruelly and wastefully
on  a planet  that is  so  sweet  (BC 18).  Vonnegut has  already
established  at this  juncture that  the chief  weapon of the sea
pirates  "was  their  capacity  to  astonish.  Nobody  else could
believe,  until it  was much  too late,  how heartless and greedy
they were" (BC  12). Thus, it comes as  no surprise that Vonnegut
believes we deserve to die horribly.
    Vonnegut spends quite a bit of time in Breakfast of Champions
letting the reader  know how easily we all  are influenced by the
media,  and  by  the  rich  people  who  own  the  newspapers, TV
stations,  radio stations,  advertising agencies,  etc. (76).  We
have been  convinced that we  need to have  a lust for  gold (25)
simply  because  "human  beings  could  be  as  easily  felled by
a single  idea as  they could  by cholera  or the bubonic plague"
(27), and we have been told  that since gold is shiny, it's worth
a lot. The reason we're so easily  brought to believe all of this
is because we're exposed to commercials and commercialism at such
a young age  that we just assume  what they tell us  must be true
and  right (90-1).  We've even   let the  media convince  us that
Mondays  are bad  (243). Imagine  that: fully  one-seventh of our
lives is ruined without us ever giving it a second thought.
    One of the  saddest commentaries made about people  is how we
allow the media  and those people who are  around us to determine
how we feel about ourselves.  Vonnegut uses a Kilgore Trout story
to  show how  we allow  ourselves  to  think we  are inferior  to
everyone else just by the  simple manipulating of some statistics
that an  advertising agency puts in  front of us (BC  170-1), and
also how  people get typecast as  being a certain way  or filling
a specific societal  role, and then become  trapped by the label.
After a while it matters not at  all what this person has to say,
because everyone else assumes they  know what this labeled person
is going to say, so they don't listen to them (BC 142).
    Vonnegut makes  a few other  random comments in  Breakfast of
Champions about people. For instance,  he refutes the belief that
rich people  are more intelligent than  poor people; they've just
been born into better circumstances  (106). He also mentions that
most people in our country  are expendable bit players because we
like to  live our lives  like people live  in story books,  where
it's always  convenient to end  a short story  or book by  having
someone shot to get rid of  them. Not only do individuals succumb
to this belief, that basically everyone other than themselves and
their close family and friends are expendable, but our government
treats people like this  also (209-210). Finally, Vonnegut points
out that the people who work  in coal mines and on assembly lines
are no more than slaves, being  paid a pittance to make money for
their master/employer (263).
    One of the  weaknesses of Slapstick is that  it doesn't break
much new ground for Vonnegut. This is shown in his comments about
the human race. He reiterates points he has made previously about
political and financial  disenfranchisement (53), allowing others
to determine  who we are  (70), and allowing  labels to determine
much in our lives (210). Though redundant, his comments are still
valid.
    Possibly the  best insight he  lends is that  we are actually
de-evolving, that we were at our best when we were innocent great
apes  with a  limited means  for doing  mischief (36). He repeats
this view a few pages later when he states that a lovely thing to
be  on this  planet is  an idiot,  better even  than being highly
intelligent,  for intelligent  people often  use their  minds for
evil purposes  (40). Shortly after this,  Vonnegut offers that we
may be  making an unconscious  effort to go  back to where  we've
come from as so much of what people talk about is utterly useless
and uninteresting (65).
    Vonnegut's first comments on  the human condition in Jailbird
focus on  the oppression of  the working-class masses.  He blasts
unions for having as their sole  aim making money, at the expense
of  the workers  they are  supposed to  represent (24), while the
business owners seek  only to make money also,  regardless of the
health and welfare of their workers  (25, 27). Part of the reason
behind feeling that  it is okay to exploit  workers is because of
the  Puritan work  ethic. A  feeling pervades  among rich people,
often in  the collective unconscious, that  they have been chosen
by  their god  to be  rich as  a blessing  for their piety, which
leads to a hypocritical humbleness (29).
    Soon  after  Vonnegut  gets  into  the  story  of  Walter  F.
Starbuck, Starbuck begins lamenting about Harvard men. The prison
Starbuck is  in is filled  with Harvard graduates,  but Starbuck,
a Harvard graduate himself, admits  that there is nothing special
about  Harvard men  (49). Of  course Starbuck,  who is  virtually
penniless as he leaves prison, has no one to give him a forgiving
hug or a free meal or a bed  for a night or two upon his release,
which doesn't say much for any class or group of people (46).
    One  way that  the rich  control the  masses is  by what they
allow us to  remember. The tale of Jesus  is constantly appearing
on TV and  the radio, and in the print  media, for Jesus said the
poor will inherit the kingdom of  God, which is exactly what rich
people want the poor to believe.  However, the story of Sacco and
Vanzetti,  who  were  both  sacrificed  as  Jesus was, is totally
forgotten by the masses, with the  exception of a few high school
history teachers. Nobody knows or  cares about them anymore, even
though they were  martyred in the name of  justice for the common
man (J 51). The members of the  elite don't want us to know about
Sacco and Vanzetti, who used common sense to show the evil of the
ruling class, so we don't ever hear about them. And it's not just
political ideology that's affected. Also due to the media hype is
the  pressure that  many college  boys, who  are really children,
feel  as they  stand on  the threshold  of manhood, especially by
those who were in college during the Great Depression. These boys
were  mocked by  their own  virginity, and  petrified of  all the
things  women would  expect of  them. Women  would expect them to
earn good  money, and they could  not see how they  could do that
with all of the businesses  shutting down. The women would expect
them to be  brave soldiers, but how could they  be sure that they
wouldn't go to  pieces when bullets flew and  flame throwers were
fired and the  guy next to them had his  head blown off? Finally,
the women would expect them to  be perfect lovers (J 53-4). Women
expected all  of this because  the books and  magazines they read
and  the movies  they watched  all presented  rich, brave men who
were fantastic  in bed. If a  male wasn't all of  the three, then
surely he wasn't a man. The same is still true today.
    Shortly after  this Vonnegut returns his  thoughts to what it
means  to  go  to  Harvard.  Apparently,  it  doesn't  mean much.
Starbuck's  son certainly  wasn't impressed  that his  father had
graduated from  there (62). Harvard  hasn't taught its  graduates
about  people and  how to  deal with  the different  knds of them
(63).  Harvard has  taught its  graduates how  to use  the law to
their advantage, how to use legal  loopholes to make money, to be
the worst criminals  of their time and still  obey the law (118).
And Harvard has taught its graduates to do absolutely whatever it
takes,  at anyone's  expense, to  make money  (126). One thing we
need to keep  in mind, however, is that  Vonnegut is simply using
Harvard as a convenient example, and that the same thing could be
said about just about any college.
    Ruth, Starbuck's wife, speaks early  in the novel on how evil
and insignificant people are (J 67). Vonnegut explains why we are
such heinous  creatures in little  niblets that are  interspersed
throughout  Jailbird.  It  starts  when  we  are  young  and  are
constantly told to shut up, which leaves  us to feel as if we, as
individuals,  must  not  have  anything  worth  saying  (170). It
continues as we grow older  and encounter so much bureaucracy and
red tape  that life becomes overly  complicated (275). Eventually
we  realize that  nobody really  knows what's  going on (149). We
finally reach the point where  we have become so totally helpless
to the powers of huge institutions and conglomerates that we fail
to  care  about  anyone  else,  and  start  to  look out only for
ourselves (280). That's why people are so evil.
    One of the aspects of Vonnegut's writing that establishes him
as a great thinker is that he realizes there are no easy answers,
and that all  issues are many-faceted. In his  look at people and
society he  shows that there  are many answers  to the questions,
How are the masses oppressed?, and Why are people so evil?
