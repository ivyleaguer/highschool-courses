<b><u>Chapter 1 - Autobiography</u></b>

    Vonnegut addresses  much of his past,  his feelings about the
past and his family, and  his own personal convictions throughout
the four books. His past and views will be discussed in, roughly,
their chronological appearance in the books.
    Early  in Slaughterhouse-Five  he reflects  on the  one great
lesson he learned from his  graduate studies in anthropology, and
that is that  no one is bad, disgusting,  or ridiculous (8). This
view  is  reflected  in  his   writings,  as  these  novels  lack
a villain, which  has been noted by  critics (Langen Harris 419).
While there are  no villains in these books,  they are peopled by
characters  who are  very human,  as attested  to by  the example
Vonnegugives of  Lot's wife (22).  When she looks  back, this act
symbolizes two  things for Vonnegut.  First, it shows  how we are
human  in  our  actions,  which  Vonnegut  loves,  and it is also
symbolic of Vonnegut looking back on his own life. In choosing to
use Lot's wife as an example to illuminate these points, Vonnegut
has made  a wise decision,  for his own  life has been  marked by
being very  human, and by being  a personal witness to  death, as
shown  by his  experiences with   the deaths  of his  parents and
sister,  and   the  135,000  deaths  he   witnessed  in  Dresden.
Slaughterhouse-Five is, among other things, Vonnegut's attempt to
come to grips  with death. He also applies death  to his art when
he quotes from  Celine, who said that no  art is possible without
a dance with death(Slaughterhouse-Five 21; hereinafter identified
as "SF").  In believing the validity  of this statement, Vonnegut
reinforces in  his mind that he  is an artist, for  he definitely
had a dance with death in Dresden, and since his book is a result
of that dance, it must be art. He is correct in both assessments.
    A    final    personal     comment    Vonnegut    makes    in
Slaughterhouse-Five concerns his own  inner struggles. When Billy
Pilgrim  starts   crying  at  his  anniversary   party  when  the
barbershop  quartet sings  "That Old  Gang of  Mine," he realizes
that somewhere inside  of himself he has a  big secret, though he
can't  imagine what  it is  (173). Years  later when  Billy is in
a hospital it  is noted that "'All  he ever does in  his sleep is
quit  and surrender  and apologize   and ask  to be  left alone'"
(184).  Still later,  Billy has  the urge  to laugh,  but doesn't
(204). These  are all indicative of  Vonnegut's own psychological
make-up.  He is  generally a   sad pessimist,  as he  mentions in
Wampeters, Foma,  & Granfallons (162),  who is still  not at ease
with his past, and he has admitted to having a problem expressing
his emotions (Slapstick 4; hereinafter identified as "S").
    Vonnegut gets  even more personal in  Breakfast of Champions,
and he wastes no time doing it. He admits on the second page that
he makes his  living by being impolite. Then  he drops hints that
he  may not  be the   most intelligent  or stable  person around,
though it's not necessarily his  fault, because other people have
put the things  in his head that don't  fit together nicely, that
are useless and ugly, and are out of proportion (5). In an effort
to  reorganize  his  brain  by  making  it  as empty as possible,
Vonnegut is  using Breakfast of  Champions as a  catharsis, as an
instrument for  throwing out the characters  from his other books
(Breakfast of Champions 5;  hereinafter identified as "BC"). This
is a lie, of course, as  both Slapstick, with a reprise of Norman
Mushari from  1965's God Bless You,  Mr. Rosewater, and Jailbird,
with the reappearance of Kilgore Trout, proving that Vonnegut has
failed  to set  his characters   free, and  also proving  that he
hasn't freed himself completely from his past.
    Kilgore  Trout is  one of  the focal  points of  Breakfast of
Champions. He is also a  representation of what Vonnegut fears he
himself might become. Early in the book Trout is an unrecognized,
dirty-old-man of  a writer who,  though he is  crying out in  the
wilderness, goes unlistened to (15). At  the very end of the book
Trout calls out to Vonnegut, who has revealed himself to Trout as
Trout's creator,  to make him young  again (295). To be  young is
something that Vonnegut  much desires, for he fears  he is coming
to the same conclusion that  his parents arrived at, whether it's
going crazy and  committing suicide like his mother  (BC 181), or
spending  his last  years in   full retreat  from life,  like his
father.  Breakfast of  Champions is  Vonnegut's fiftieth birthday
present to himself  (4-5), and he's come to  the realization that
he  may be  becoming more  like his  parents than  he wants to be
(193).
    The  other focal  point of  Breakfast of  Champions is Dwayne
Hoover, who  is also very  much like Vonnegut.  Dwayne has a  dog
named  Sparky that  he likes  to get  down on  the floor and roll
around with and talk to (18). Throughout Vonnegut's life this has
been one of his own great  joys, to share fun and friendship with
another  creature without  love ever  entering into  the equation
(S  2-3).   Dwayne  takes  this   even  further  in   his  sexual
relationship with his secretary,  Francine Pefko. Though they are
lovers,  and  have  been  for  a  while,  Dwayne  has a pact with
Francine that neither  of them are ever to  mention love as being
part   of  their   relationship  (152).   The  relationships   in
Vonnegut's  life that  he thinks  have been  marked by love could
easily be described  as being marked by common  decency, and love
might not necessarily have had much,  if anything, to do with the
relationship (S 2). Vonnegut further states on the same page that
he cannot  distinguish between the love  he has for dogs  and the
love he has for people. The one thing Vonnegut always admired and
adored about  Laurel and Hardy  (to whom he  dedicated Slapstick)
was that  love was never  at issue with  them, but bargaining  in
good faith  was (S 1-2),  for love can  be used as  an excuse for
doing just about anything, such as fighting or being jealous, but
showing  common  decency  to  others  will  more  often result in
a happy ending (S 3).
    After the  lovemaking and Kentucky Fried  Chicken incident in
Breakfast  of Champions,  Francine takes  on a  maternal role for
Dwayne, and, seeking her wisdom, Dwayne asks Francine to tell him
what life is  all about (165). This ties in  with the final scene
of the novel  when Vonnegut, as a participating  character in the
book,  starts  ruminating  to  himself  about  how the wealth and
grandeur  of his  grandparents on  both sides  of the  family had
totally disappeared by his childhood.  This helped him to realize
the temporariness  and insignificance of everything  that was and
is  (288). So  what can  Vonnegut  put  his faith  into? This  is
a question he has yet to answer.
    The  most important  and deepest  personal statement Vonnegut
makes  in Breakfast  of Champions   is not  made with  words. His
sketches populate the  book, but the self-portrait at  the end of
the book that goes along with the brief author biography is quite
telling.  Vonnegut  could  have  chosen  any  emotion  or mood to
represent himself, and  the mood he chose was  that of sorrow and
pain. The single, massive tear drop leaving his eye is indicative
of  the pain  he has  felt in  trying to  make sense  out of this
existence.
    Slapstick is  the closest Vonnegut will  ever come to writing
an autobiography  (1). He reveals  through a conversation  he had
with his brother Bernard that he  was sick of writing, and always
had been (16), but that he  had always written for an audience of
one,  for  their  deceased  sister  (15).  After  recounting that
incident he mentions that he lit up a cigarette, and that Bernard
didn't, because  Bernard didn't smoke anymore.  He says that it's
important that Bernard not smoke because Bernard must live a good
while longer due  to the fact that two  little boys are depending
on  him. In  puffing away,  Vonnegut is  telling the  reader that
it's no  big deal if he  himself should die, that  he's become an
expendable cog.
    The  issue  of  love  is  prevalent  in  the  second  half of
Slapstick.  The  dizygotic  neanderthaloid  twins  in  the novel,
Wilbur Rockefeller Swain and Eliza  Mellon Swain, are symbolic of
Vonnegut and his late sister,  Alice. When Wilbur tells Eliza for
the first  time that he  loves her, Eliza  says that she  doesn't
like it, because it's as if Wilbur  is putting a gun to her head,
for what else can Eliza, or  anybody, say but, "I love you, too?"
(108). Later when Wilbur encounters Eliza, for what will prove to
be the  last time, Eliza is  hovering above him in  a helicopter.
Wilbur shouts out to her that he loves her, to which she replies,
"'Nobody  should ever  say that  to anybody'"  (139). Vonnegut is
reinforcing his desire to  share relationships of common decency,
rather than of love.
    A parting shot  that Vonnegut makes at love  is in regards to
his own terminated marriage to Jane Cox. Late in the novel Wilbur
is talking  to his nearest  neighbor, Vera Chipmunk-5  Zappa, who
was  a victim  of spousal  abuse. When  Wilbur asks  her what the
moral is  of one of  the stories she's  told him about  her dead,
wife-beating husband,  she tells him,  "'Wilbur - don't  ever get
married'" (209).
    Early  in  Jailbird  Vonnegut  refers  again  to his mother's
suicide  (11).  Obviously,  even  though  it occurred thirty-five
years before the  publication of the book, it  still affects him.
It is  no wonder, then, that  Vonnegut follows up the  mention of
his  mother's  suicide  with  a  short  tale  about  his  time as
a professor at Harvard, during which time his first marriage came
to an end  and his home was going to  pieces. He confided this to
one of his students, who replied, "'It shows!'" (11). Vonnegut is
not one who  assimilates hardships well, and he  knows it. Due to
the  suicide of  his mother  and  the  retreat from  life of  his
father,  Vonnegut says  that an   air of  defeat has  always been
a companion of his (13).
    Midway through Jailbird Vonnegut  turns to thoughts about the
tough  times  and  unfortunate  circumstances  of  this world. In
Nineteen-hundred and  Thirty- one the  main character, Walter  F.
Starbuck, takes Sarah Wyatt, one of  the four girls he would ever
love, out on  the town in New York City.  Sarah's family has been
plagued  by  tragedy,  as  the  clock  company  her  family owned
accidently  poisoned almost  fifty female  employees with radium,
all of whom had already died,  or were about to (144). Her family
lost its wealth. Walter, who's a  student at Harvard at the time,
goes to  pick her up in  New York, where she  is staying with her
paternal grandmother  for the weekend  (135). Sarah has  a nearly
habitual laugh,  whether the subject  is her beauty,  sex, or the
Depression. Her grandmother scolds her by saying there is nothing
constructive in laughing all the  time. "'I can cry, too,'" Sarah
says. "'You  want me to cry?'"  (143). This scene is  a microcosm
for Vonnegut's  life: so much  that has been  in this world  (his
parents'   and   sister's   death,   Dresden,   his   son  Mark's
schizophrenic breakdown)  could make him  cry, but he  chooses to
laugh  instead.  And  while  this  scene  shows  Sarah  coping by
laughing as an eighteen year old, she is shown later in her life,
even into her  sixties, to be using the same  tactic to cope with
the deaths of the patients at  the hospital where she works (175,
243).
