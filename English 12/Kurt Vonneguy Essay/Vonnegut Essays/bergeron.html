<b>Uniformity and Deformity in "Harrison Bergeron"</b>
An exploration of the main theme of "Harrison Bergeron"
Marek Vit

     In this essay, I will  attempt to explore what Kurt Vonnegut
illustrated in his short story "Harrison Bergeron"--the fact that
uniformity (of any kind) leads  to the loss of individuality, and
therefore to absolute deformity of humanness.
     "The year  was 2081, and  everybody was finally  equal," the
story begins.  "They weren't only  equal before God  and the law.
They were  equal in every  which way." (Vonnegut  1968:7) In this
haunting story,  Vonnegut probably wanted to  warn our society of
similar kind  of equality, equality  that can be  fatal for human
race.
     The  theme of  absolute  equality  has already  appeared two
years before "Harrison Bergeron" was published for the first time
in   <u>Fantasy  and   Science-Fiction  Magazine</u>   (1961).  It   was
Vonnegut's novel <u>The  Sirens of Titan</u>. However, in  this work the
theme is  only a minor feature  and is not really  developed (see
Vonnegut 1975:158). The idea probably intrigued Kurt Vonnegut and
forced  him to  develop it  into  a  short story.  Those who  are
familiar  with Kurt  Vonnegut's writing  will certainly recognize
some  other  themes  of  this  story.  For  example  the  fear of
de-humanization of human beings,  being stuck in amber (Harrisons
inability to overthrow the system) and so forth.
     In "Harrison Bergeron", Kurt Vonnegut presented a scary view
of  a  future  society,  where  everyone  was  equal. "Nobody was
smarter than anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody
else.  Nobody  was  stronger   or  quicker  than  anybody  else."
(Vonnegut 1988:7).  It was the  job of the  agents of the  United
States Handicapper General to keep  it this way. Beautiful people
had  to wear  ugly masks.  People not  heavy enough  had to  wear
handicap bags full of lead. Clever  people had to wear a radio in
their  ear tuned  to the  government transmitter,  which sent out
sharp  noises  to  keep  people  from  taking  advantage of their
brains.  It was  a world  where competition  was the  greatest of
sins.
     I think that this view can  be very easily related to modern
society. People are striving  for equality of some kind--equality
of  races, sexes  etc. People  try to  eliminate racism,  sexism,
lookism,  ableism, ageism.  Even  the  word speciesism  starts to
appear  in modern  dictionaries of  Politically Correct language.
The society in "Harrison Bergeron" succeeded in eliminating these
prejudices--everybody   got   the    same   opportunity   to   do
anything--and the result was fatal.
     When the power got into the hands of stupid people unfit for
governing the  country, they had to  find a way to  protect their
position. So they came with  the idea of handicaps, which brought
all the above-average people and  the average people to the level
of  the below-average  ones. Thus,  their position  of power  was
preserved. The  result was that people  lost their individuality,
lost their humanity.
     Theodore  Sturgeon's  novel  <u>Godbody</u>  deals  with  a problem
seemingly distant from  this, yet I think it  is very similar. It
deals with human sexuality and  nakedness. In the introduction to
this book, Robert A. Heinlein said:

           "God  must love  skin since  he makes  so much  of it.
     Covering  it with  cloth or  leather or  fur in  the name of
     'decency' is a vice thought up by dirty old men; don't blame
     it on God." (Heinlein in the introduction to Sturgeon)

     A  great  example  of  such  an  indecent  (or  perhaps more
importantly, envious)  character in "Harrison  Bergeron" is Diana
Moon Glampers. In <u>God Bless  You, Mr. Rosewater</u>, she is described
as a  "sixty-year-old virgin who, by  almost anybody's standards,
was too dumb to live." (Vonnegut  1978:56) "No one had ever loved
her.  There  was  no  reason  why  anybody  should. She was ugly,
stupid,  and boring."  (Vonnegut 1978:56)  In "Harrison Bergeron"
she got  a position at the  top of the society  and she wanted to
keep it.  That's why she killed  Harrison and the girl  he danced
with.  They represented  a great  danger. Had  they succeeded  in
overthrowing the  system, she'd be just  an unsuccessful woman on
the bottom of the society. It was vital for her to shoot them and
preserve the monstrous society.
     There  is a  certain resemblance  of the  story and  several
periods of  human history. Dictatorships worked,  and still work,
this  way. A  wonderful example  is the  communist system in some
eastern-european countries  (e.g. the Czech  Republic) which was,
fortunately,  overthrown in  1989. People  were discouraged  from
thinking  by  themselves,  discouraged  from  forming  their  own
opinions. Children were "processed" in  schools to be all uniform
in mind  and opinion. People  were then more  easily manipulable,
which was the goal of the communist party.
     And this is probably what Kurt  Vonnegut tried to warn us in
"Harrison Bergeron". Don't let anything  or anyone deprive you of
your  individuality. Otherwise  you  will  lose your  humanity as
well. If  we continue in striving  for equality, we could  end up
like  the society  in "Harisson  Bergeron". If  we get  as far as
eliminating speciesism, we can end up  like in the short story by
Kilgore Trout "Hail to the  Chief", where a chimpanzee became the
President of the United States.

           "The chimpanzee  wore a little blue  blazer with brass
     buttons, and  with the seal  of the President  of the United
     States sewed to the breast pocket. It looked like this:

           Everywhere  he went,  bands  would  play 'Hail  to the
     Chief.'  The chimpanzee  loved it.  He would  bounce up  and
     down." (Vonnegut 1992:88)
