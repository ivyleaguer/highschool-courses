<b>Understanding Religion Through <i>Cat's Cradle</i></b>
Liana Price


      The following  is issued as a  warning from the author 
Kurt Vonnegut  to the reader: "Any  one unable to understand 
how  a  useful  religion  can  be  founded  on lies will not 
understand  this  book  either"(14).  The  latter  quote  is 
typical  of Vonnegut  in his  usage of  creating a  personal 
narrative.
       Kurt Vonnegut Jr. was born in Indianapolis, like many 
of  his characters,  in 1922.  His life  from that  point on 
closely resembles  the lives of the  people in his satirical 
novel <i>Cat's Cradle</i>. Vonnegut's mother committed suicide when 
he was  twenty two years old  and in many of  his novels the 
character  of  the  mother  is  dead.  Vonnegut's  "lifelong 
pessimism clearly  has its roots in  his parents' despairing 
response to  the depression" (Allen  2). He was  captured in 
WWII and was present in  Dresden, Germany when it was bombed 
and set fire to, killing 135,000 citizens. This later became 
the     basis     for     Vonnegut's     greatest    success 
<i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>.
       <i>Cat's  Cradle</i> was  published in  1963, and  though it 
wasn't as big a success  as <i>Slaughterhouse</i>, it became widely 
known as contributing to the "counter-culture" since it does 
in  fact  question  and  counter  almost  every  part of our 
society's culture  (Reed). One of the  largest points of our 
culture brought  into question in <i>Cat's  Cradle</i> is religion. 
Vonnegut himself  is a Humanist, meaning  that he isn't sure 
of the existence  of a God, but values  life above all else. 
In  his  last  novel  <i>Timequake</i>,  Vonnegut  explains that he 
understands that  humans need religion as  something to turn 
to for comfort and support (<i>Timequake</i> 63).
      <i>Cat's  Cradle</i> tells  a  fictional  account of  how the 
world  met  its  end.  There  are  actually  three different 
writers  at work  in the  story. First  and foremost  is the 
author Kurt  Vonnegut. The narrator he  creates in his novel 
is called John, or Jonah as  he tells the reader to refer to 
him (Vonnegut  1), and he  frequently recites passages  from 
The Books  of Bokonon written by  a fictional religious guru 
Bokonon (Reed  125). All three  hold true to  a passage from 
another  of  Vonnegut's  books  "lies  told  for the sake of 
artistic  effect...can  be..  the  most  beguiling  forms of 
truth"(Vonnegut Editor's Note) Though  Jonah is most closely 
linked  to  representing  Vonnegut,   Bokonon  is  the  most 
interesting character  created on the Island  of San Lorenzo 
where most of  the book takes place. By  having this central 
yet  elusive character  invent  a  religion openly  based on 
lies,  Vonnegut demonstrates  society's blind  dependency on 
religion:

            I wanted all things
            To seem to make some sense,
            So we all could be happy, yes,
            Instead of tense.
            And I made up lies
            So that they all fit nice,
            And I made this sad world
            A par-a-dise (Vonnegut 90)

The latter  quote describing why  Bokonon, christened Lionel 
Boyd Johnson on the Island  of Tobago in 1891 (Vonnegut 74), 
invented  Bokononism  is  said  to  be  found  in  Bokonon's 
"Calypsos",  or short  poems/songs. When  Bokonon was  still 
known  as  Lionel,  before  he  reached  the  shores  of San 
Lorenzo,  he was  a sailor  whose ships  crashed 6 different 
times.  It  was  during  these  unexplainable incidents that 
Lionel  met  up  with  "brilliant, self-educated, idealistic 
Marine  deserter"  Earl  McCabe  who  had  just  stolen  his 
company's money (Vonnegut 77). The two set off for Miami but 
wrecked on  the shores of  San Lorenzo. This  is when Lionel 
became Bokonon, not through  some mystic vision, but because 
it was  how the natives pronounced  Johnson. The tiny island 
of San  Lorenzo and its  inhabitants effectively become  for 
Vonnegut a symbol  for society when it is  at its lowest and 
most  desperate. It  is a  densely populated  area with "450 
inhabitants  for  each  uninhabitable  square mile"(94). The 
people are  described as thin, starving,  with missing teeth 
and bowed  or swollen legs.  The island itself  is worthless 
and when Bokonon and McCabe  arrived and announced they were 
taking control of the island,  those that had been trying to 
rule quietly  stepped down. McCabe and  Bokonon split up the 
duties to make the island  a "par-a-dise" with McCabe taking 
control  of  the  government  and  Bokonon,  "cynically  and 
playfully", inventing  the new national  religion(118). Both 
Bokonon  and  McCabe  soon  came  to  the  realization  that 
religion was the  only real way they were  going to make the 
people happy since the island would always be worthless.
      Vonnegut now  shows the reader his  true insights into 
why society  craves religion so  vehemently: "Truth was  the 
enemy of the  people, because the truth was  so terrible, so 
Bokonon  made it  his business  to provide  the people  with 
better  and  better  lies"  (118).  In  essence, Vonnegut is 
saying that religion is nothing  more than foma, or harmless 
untruths (copyright  page), told to  cover up the  horrible, 
unexplainable  truths  out  there.  Bokononism  becomes like 
a sensational  play to  the people  of San  Lorenzo in which 
they are all actors in  a play they understand. Bokonon told 
McCabe  to  outlaw  his  religion  in  order  to  "give  the 
religious life of the people more zest" (118). It is easy to 
see  how fake  the religion  becomes with  the cruel  tyrant 
McCabe in  the city and the  gentle holy man Bokonon  in the 
jungle (119), but it is the only thing that gives the people 
any source of joy. Bokonon has a theory of "Dynamic Tension" 
that  talks of  the balance  between good  and evil and that 
good  societies can  only  survive  by keeping  the tensions 
between these  two things high  at all times.  He and McCabe 
take on these roles:

            "Papa" Monzano, he's so very bad,
            But without bad "Papa" I would be so sad;
            Because without "Papa's" badness,
            Tell me, if you would,
            How could wicked old Bokonon
            Ever, ever look good (74)?

This theory  of Dynamic Tension  can be seen  throughout the 
world today. People, it seems,  can not be happy unless they 
have something to fight for and  in most cases, like the one 
in <i>Cat's  Cradle</i>, it is their  religion. Bokononists realize 
that "there  is no decipherable  meaning in the  workings of 
the  world, but  we can  play as  if there  were some" (Reed 
126). The religion  pokes fun at the <i>Bible</i>  for believing it 
has all the right answers by paraphrasing a quote from Jesus 
that states, "Render therefore  unto Caesar the things which 
are Caesar's", The Bokononist version goes "Pay no attention 
to  Caesar. Caesar  doesn't have  the slightest  idea what's 
really going on" (Vonnegut  73). This apparent contradiction 
between  Bokononist  thought  and  Christian,  cynically and 
humorously points out the lack of true meaning and relevance 
in religion.
      The most important thing to Bokononists is man. In the 
Books of  Bokonon, when Bokonon  tells the story  of how man 
was created,  he has man  ask God what  the meaning of  "all 
this"  is. God  replies that  he doesn't  see why everything 
must have a  meaning and if man does, he  leaves man to find 
one(177).  This is  how Vonnegut,  as well  as Bokonon, sees 
religion, a hopeless search for truths that don't exist.
      Through Vonnegut's other  characters there arises more 
insight into how different people view religion and society. 
Julian Castle refers  to Jesus as "oh, Him"  and that people 
only talk about Jesus and other religious icons because they 
need  "to keep  their voice  boxes in  working order in case 
there's  ever  anything  really  meaningful  to  say" (116). 
Julian  here demontratates  his Bokononist  view of  life by 
accepting  the  fact  that  though  he  talks  of  Jesus and 
religion, he  knows it means nothing.  Jonah is surprised to 
find out that  all the people on the  island are Bokononists 
and  that he  is one  also (118).  This refers  back to  the 
reason he wants  to be called Jonah. It is  both a parody of 
Melville's Moby Dick  and an allusion to the  Bible story of 
Jonah. "It is characteristic  that Vonnegut's speaker should 
be a  Jonah, who..gets swallowed  by the whale,  rather than 
a whale- hunting  Ishmael"(Reed 124). The  whale, of course, 
symbolizes Bokononism and religion  in general. Jonah is the 
only character  with running inner dialogue  in which we see 
his struggle with  power once he is offered  the rule of San 
Lorenzo.  He  quickly  gets  rid  of  his  allusions to make 
Bokononism  a  welcome  religion,  recognizing  the  Dynamic 
Tension that  must be present  in society. He  also found it 
impossible not to  "lean on God" to write  his speech (152). 
Jonah  is  also  confronted   with  the  cold,  but  lovely, 
embodiment of Bokononism, Mona  Aamons Monzano. She grows up 
as the sexual  icon for her people and  hating it, runs away 
to study  under Bokonon. The  religion of harmless  untruths 
helps her cope by taking away  her emotion. The only time an 
outburst  is elicited  from her  is when  Jonah tells her to 
love only him. This, under Bokononist thought, is considered 
utterly  wrong  and  when  Mona  tells  this  to  Jonah  she 
challengingly asks what his religion says about this. Again, 
it is  pointed out that  religions who boast  of loving only 
one  person  don't  make  much  sense  and  seem barbaric to 
Bokononists:

            A lover's a liar,
            To himself he lies.
            The truthful are loveless,
            Like oysters their eyes! ( 156)

      The title  of Kurt Vonnegut's novel  comes from Newton 
Hoenikker's, or Newt's, speech to Jonah about the deceptions 
society  teaches its  children. Newt  tells Jonah  that "for 
maybe a hundred thousand years or more, grown- ups have been 
waving  tangles  of  string  in  their  children's faces...A 
cat's  cradle  is  nothing  but   a  bunch  of  X's  between 
somebody's hands, and little kids  look and look and look at 
all  those X's.....No  damn cat,  and no  damn cradle"(114). 
This  is  a  proper  analogy  for  all  aspects  of society, 
especially religion. Society makes something up and pretends 
it's something it's not. For  instance, religion says it has 
all the answers, but when  it is examined closer, nothing is 
really there.  This just, once  again, reiterates the  point 
that religion is only a thin facade created by man to answer 
otherwise unanswerable questions, but it is all lies.
      Newt's father and brother both serve the purpose of in 
the novel  showing the scientific  view of religion.  Newt's 
father  Felix  was  the  creator  of  the  atom bomb and was 
described as being "so innocent  he was practically a Jesus" 
but, as one  man asked, "how the hell innocent  is a man who 
helps make a thing like  an atomic bomb?"(Vonnegut 53). This 
comparison to Jesus  is striking. It takes a  man who caused 
hundreds of  thousands of deaths by  creating something, and 
compares  him to  Jesus. Once  the comparison  is made it is 
surprisingly relevant in that  Jesus created a religion that 
would,  over time,  cause  hundreds  of thousands  of deaths 
also. Religion was and is the  topic of many wars around the 
world,   Christianity   being   one   of  those  conflicting 
religions. At one  point he asks why he  should "bother with 
made-up games" such as religion "when there are so many real 
ones going on"(Vonnegut 17). He was a realist in every sense 
and wasn't  one to go  searching for lies.  Felix questioned 
everything and it is easy  to assume he believed in nothing. 
He  didn't  believe  in  sin  (Vonnegut  21),  and  he  once 
challenged a woman to tell him one thing that was absolutely 
true,  knowing  she  could  not  answer  satisfactorily.  He 
responded to her  reply of "God is love"  by asking "What is 
God? What is love?" (44).
      The woman, Miss Faust, is a typical devout in that she 
refuses  to  question  her  faith.  Her  name is conspicuous 
because of its correlation with  the Faust legends. In these 
legends a person  sells his soul to the  devil for something 
he wants,  and later regrets his  decision. Since Miss Faust 
represents  all  those  devout  people  who  will not accept 
anything outside  their narrow view  of religion, the  Faust 
legend applies  to all these  people. They sell  their minds 
and their ability  to think for themselves to  a religion to 
have an easy way to comfort themselves which will eventually 
lead to their disappointment.
      The  capitalists  are  unfavorably  represented by the 
often  unwittingly humorous  and ignorant  Crosby's. H. Lowe 
Crosby and his  wife Hazel are both from  Chicago. Crosby is 
all  in  favor  of  business  and  is  more  than willing to 
sacrifice  independence  and  originality  in  order to turn 
a profit. He  is leaving Chicago  because of it's  growth in 
human  relations  and  going  to  San  Lorenzo because, "the 
people  down there  are poor  enough and  scared enough  and 
ignorant  enough to  have some  common sense"(Vonnegut  66). 
Vonnegut  describes  him  as   confronting  the  world  with 
"a certain  barn-yard clownishness" but  he also points  out 
that he  wasn't a fool  and that many  things he said  about 
"undisciplined mankind  were not only funny  but true" (68). 
Hazel is a  bit more blatantly muddled than  her husband and 
is a firm believer in granfalloons. A granfalloon, according 
to  Bokonon,  is  a  seeming  team  of  individuals  that is 
meaningless in  terms of the  ways God gets  things done:"If 
you  wish to  study a  granfalloon, Just  remove the skin of 
a toy balloon."  (67-68) As they arrived  at San Lorenzo and 
were  waiting  on  a  platform  to  meet  the  ruler, "Papa" 
Monzano, Hazel  looked out at the  silent and unhappy people 
and told that  she was "sure glad it's  a Christian country" 
or she'd  be a little  scared (96). She  automatically falls 
back  on  her  religion  for  comfort  in  a  scary  and new 
situation   never  realizing   that  this   nation  is   not 
a Christian one, but  a poor one. The irony  that the people 
turn out  to be Bokonists shows  that religion only comforts 
us in our own mind,  like Hazel's, but doesn't actually have 
any real effects on those around us.
      The only hospital in San  Lorenzo is the House of Hope 
and Mercy run by Julian  Castle, an American millionaire who 
was  repenting   for  his  former  life   of  indulgence  by 
unselfishly devoting his life to the miserable people of the 
jungle island. His son Philip Castle was tutored by Bokonon. 
He gave his reason for  not following his father's footsteps 
with  a story  of how  one year  bubonic plague  came to San 
Lorenzo and in bed after bed  there were dead bodies and his 
father  started  to  giggle  and  make  his flashlight dance 
around the dead people stacked  outside and turned to Philip 
to  say, "Son,  someday this  will all  be yours"(112).  The 
other doctor at the hospital  was also doing penance. He was 
a camp doctor  at Auschwitz for  six years. He  saves people 
night and day and, as Julian tells Jonah, "If he keeps going 
at his  present rate...the number of  people he's saved will 
equal the number of people he let die..in 3010"(127). Julian 
calls himself  a Bokononist because  he agrees with  Bokonon 
that all religions are lies. He is also a fitting Bokononist 
because he recognizes the need for religion to make some one 
feel  better whether  it is  scientific and  truthful or not 
(148).
      In <i>Cat's Cradle</i>, the end of the world comes about when 
all the  oceans, streams, lakes,  and other bodies  of water 
freeze  because of  an invention  of Felix  Hoenniker's that 
teaches  water  to  crystallize  as  hard  as  a  desk  with 
a melting   point  of   one  hundred   and  thirty   degrees 
Fahrenheit. As soon as it  touches human skin or gets inside 
the body,  all blood turns to  ice and the person  dies. The 
reactions of the various people  on San Lorenzo give insight 
into  their  character.  The  Crosby's  run  away  from  the 
tornadoes that  suddenly form because of  the sudden lack of 
moisture yelling  "American! American!"(175), true  to their 
granfalloonery and belief that what they classify themselves 
as  in their  heads will  have any  effect on the happenings 
around  them.  The  people  of  San  Lorenzo,  the  ones who 
survived until the tornadoes left the surface, found Bokonon 
and captured him. They carried him to the top of the highest 
mountain on the  island to tell them what  God was doing and 
how  they should  react. Bokonon  tells them  that "God  was 
surely trying  to kill them...and that  they should have the 
good manners to die"(182). At that, they all touched the ice 
to their mouths and died. He gave them a simple way out, and 
since they had lived their lives by somebody else's lies for 
the reason  that it made  things simple, they  died that way 
also. Bokonon didn't take his own advice however, he knew it 
was worthless (182).
      Throughout the novel Jonah is searching for the reason 
for his existence and what all these strange coincidences in 
his life are leading up to.  John tells Newt of his dream of 
climbing the mountain on San Lorenzo to put up a symbol, but 
he doesn't know what the symbol should be. At the end of the 
novel Jonah  finds Bokonon sitting  by the side  of the road 
writing the last page of the Books of Bokonon:

            If I were a younger man, I would write a history 
     of  human stupidity;  and I  would climb  to the top of 
     Mount McCabe  and lie down  on my back  with my history 
     for a pillow; and I would  take from the ground some of 
     the blue-white  poison that makes  statues of men;  and 
     I  would make  a statue  of myself,  lying on  my back, 
     grinning  horribly, and  thumbing my  nose at  You Know 
     Who. (191)

It can be assumed that <i>Cat's Cradle</i> is the history of "human 
stupidity" Bokonon  spoke of, and  this would also  "satisfy 
Jonah's  original intention  of  writing  The Day  the World 
Ended" (Reed  124) like he  originally said he  would. It is 
also  conclusive to  find that  the symbol  Jonah dreamed of 
carrying was Bokonon.
      Through Vonnegut's  unique characters and  his cynical 
view of society, the pivotal role religion plays in everyday 
life is  brought into new perspective  and its very validity 
is questioned.  Bokononism becomes the one  true religion of 
all  the people  in  Vonnegut's  fictional world  because it 
recognizes  that it,  the religion,  is trash  and its  only 
purpose  is to  give meaning   to a  world where  no meaning 
exists.  The  only  people  who  take  it  seriously are the 
miserable  villagers  of  San  Lorenzo  who  end  up killing 
themselves  because they  refuse to  question their religion 
though  it  admits  to  being  made  of lies. Newt describes 
religion best:
           Little Newt snorted. 'Religion!'
           'See the cat?' asked Newt. 'See the cradle?'(124)
