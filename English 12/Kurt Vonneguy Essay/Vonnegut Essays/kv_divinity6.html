<b><u>Conclusion</u></b>
    This essay has  dealt with the images of  humanity and God as
seen by Kurt Vonnegut, two images frequently appearing in most of
his books.  It has been shown  that Humanity and Divinity  in his
novels can be taken and  examined as any literary characters, can
be attributed character traits etc.
    Humanity  has been  examined first:  its physical appearance,
the  environment and  its actions.  People have  been found to be
neglecting themselves, neglecting the environment, and neglecting
one  another.  Apart  from  causing  ecological catastrophies and
cruel wars humans have been  found to be causing catastrophies of
their own lives,  being driven into doom by  fatal lusts, such as
sex, money  and ambition. However,  Vonnegut seems to  find these
drives  to be  pre-programmed in  human beings,  as if  they were
machines.  He supplies  a definition  of 'a  machine' into  which
Humanity fits almost perfectly. There is one detail, however that
does not fit: human imagination.
    Divinity  has been  found to  be the  'higher force'  that is
responsible  for Humanity,  yet it  is altogether  indifferent to
people and  all of its  creation. It either  does not care  about
what  it  created  at  all,   or  follows  its  mysterious  plans
regardless the human beings and  other creation. Divinity is seen
as  a  cruel  puppet-master  leading  its  puppets  into terrible
situations.  It is  seen as  a writer  who likes  to write  about
suffering. It is  seen as the oversize brain  of Humanity, making
people do terrible things.
    Further,   this  essay   identified  the   villain  and  hero
characters in Vonnegut's books.  Humanity was found 'not guilty',
since it must obey the puppet  master, it must do things that are
beyond its control. The blame, therefore, lies on Divinity. It is
the villain. Humanity  is, therefore, left the post  of the hero.
Humanity could not  claim it, however, if there  was not anything
more  to people  than dead  machinery. It  has been  proved, that
there  was something  more: Humanity's  soul, its  awareness, its
imagination by which it managed  to outwit Divinity and thus win.
Humanity therefore is identifies as  the hero and Divinity as the
villain.
    This   essay  has   also  dealt   with  application   of  the
relationship  between  Humanity  and  Divinity  to  Kurt Vonnegut
himself. It has shown that  Vonnegut, having to go through really
bad times (such  as WWII) was trying to find  a way how one could
'love his neighbor'.  He managed to cleanse people  of their sins
and love what  is good in them. The bad  things, the evil things,
he manages to attribute to a higher entity, Divinity.
    The  end of  the essay  has shortly  dealt with  similarities
between Vonnegut's  views and Christians' views.  There have been
found many common  features with one difference: who  sits in the
dock.
