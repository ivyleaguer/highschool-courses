<b>The Themes of Kurt Vonnegut's <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i></b>

"Be kind. Don't hurt. Death is coming for all of us anyway,
and it is better to be Lot's wife looking back through salty
eyes than the Deity that destroyed those cities of the plain
in order to save them."

<font size=+3><b>Introduction</b></font>
      <i>Slaughterhouse-Five;  or  The  Children's  Crusade,  A Duty
Dance With Death</i> is surely  the best achievement of Kurt Vonnegut
and  even one  of the   most acclaimed  works in  modern American
literature.  It  is  a  very  personal  novel  which  draws  upon
Vonnegut's  own experience  in World  War Two.  He was an advance
scout  with the  106th Infantry  Division, a  prisoner of war and
a witness to  the fire-bombing of Dresden  on 13th February 1945.
135,000 people died in the ruins  of Dresden, which means that it
was the greatest man-caused massacre  of all times (71,379 people
were killed by the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima.)
      Vonnegut manages to  tell the reader many things  and it is
hard to  decide, what exactly  is the main  theme. It is  a novel
about  war, about  the cruelty  and violence  done in  war, about
people and their nature, their selfishness, about love, humanity,
regeneration, motion, and death.
      I will try to explore the  novel in a greater depth and try
to say  which of the  themes mentioned characterizes  the book to
the greatest extent.

<font size=+3><b>Kurt Vonnegut and his writing</b></font>
      Kurt  Vonnegut Jr.  was born  in 1922.  He is  an author of
numerous novels and short stories, two plays and several works of
non-fiction. Most of his books are affected by his war experience
(<i>Hocus Pocus, Mother  Night</i> etc.), although in some  novels it is
really hard to identify. In <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, however, the war
experiences are obvious from the beginning.
      All his books are strongly satirical and ironical (Vonnegut
often uses  very dark humor), funny,  compassionate and extremely
wise. They mostly have a very poor  plot (or none at all) and the
emphasis is  put onto the  rather comic and  pathetic characters.
Kurt Vonnegut also very often uses science fiction and comic book
formulas (quick action, short dialogues etc.), which usually puts
his  books  onto  bookstore  shelves  marked  "sci-fi". Vonnegut,
however,  doesn't   take  the  sci-fi   elements  with  the   sam
e seriousness  as the  other  sci-fi  writers, and  that probably
makes the difference between his works and science fiction.
      In <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>,  many characters from  his previous
books show up (Mr.  Rosewater, Kilgore Trout, the Tralfamadorians
etc.) The reader can also  recognize some themes that appeared in
Vonnegut's  earlier   books  (War  vs.   Love;  Life  vs.   human
understanding etc). Some  critiques described <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>
as a summary of his previous five novels.

<font size=+3><b>Structure of <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i></b></font>
      The book has two narratives.  One is personal and the other
is  impersonal. The  latter is  the story  of Billy  Pilgrim who,
similarly  to  the  author,  fights  in  World  War Two, is taken
prisoner  by  the  Germans  and  witnesses  the  fire-storming of
Dresden.  The personal  narrative is  Vonnegut's own  story about
writing a book about the worst experience of his life. It appears
mostly  in the  first chapter,  and describes  his temptation  to
write a book about Dresden and his efforts to finally produce it.
The p ersonal  view also appears in the  tenth (and last) chapter
and  surfaces twice  in the  Billy Pilgrim's  story ("That was I.
That was me.  That was the author of this  book." - Vonnegut 1969
p.125, 148). This can assure the reader of particular identity of
the author with Billy.
      Billy Pilgrim  has a unique  ability to become  "unstuck in
time", which means that he can uncontrollably drift from one part
of his  life to another  "and the trips  aren't necessarily fun,"
(ibid p.23).  The whole book is  organized in the same  way Billy
moves in  time. It consists  of numerous sections  and paragraphs
strung together  in no chronological order,  seemingly at random.
The whole  narration is written  in the past  tense, so that  the
reader cannot identify where the author's starting point is. This
aspect of the  book is identical with the  Tralfamadorian type of
books:

           'There isn't any  particular relationship between
    all the messages, except that the author has chosen them
    carefully, so that, when seen  all at once, they produce
    an image  of life that  is beautiful and  surprising and
    deep.  There  is  no  beginning,  no  middle, no end, no
    suspense, no moral, no causes,  no effects. What we love
    in our  books are the  depths of many  marvelous moments
    seen all at one time.' (ibid p.88).

I think that this describes <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> quite fully.
      After having read about Billy being an optometrist, another
explanation  of  why  the  book  has  no  frame  occurs. The last
sentence  of the  paragraph  about  optometry reads:  "Frames are
where the money is," (ibid  p.24). Wayne McGinnis has pointed out
that  historical events,  like  the  destruction of  Dresden, are
usually   "read"  in   a  framework   of  moral   and  historical
interpretation  and that  is where  this book  differs from other
books of its kind (Bryfonski 1978 p.529).
      In my opinion, however, the narration is linear. One period
of Billy's life  is told in a line -  Billy's story from the war.
I admit  that  the  line  of  narration  is  broken by many other
events,  but every  time a  war  story  begins, it  takes up  the
narrative  at the  moment when  the previous  war story ended. It
seems that  Vonnegut, who had  wanted to write  a war novel,  now
wanted  to avoid  writing about  it. The  war seems  to have been
a great  tempting  magnet  for  him,  and  Vonnegut was trying to
escape its power. He managed to  do so, to some extent, but every
now and then the story falls back into World War Two.

<font size=+3><b>The Themes of <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i></b></font>
      The  first theme  of <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>,  and perhaps  the
most  obvious, is  the war  and its  contrast with  love, beauty,
humanity,  innocence  etc.  <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>,  like Vonnegut's
previous books,  manages to tell  us that war  is bad for  us and
that it would  be better for us to love  one another. To find the
war's  contrast with  love is  quite difficult,  because the book
doesn't talk about any couple that  was cruelly torn apart by the
war (Billy didn't seem to love  his wife very much, for example.)
V onnegut expresses  it very lightly,  uses the word  "love" very
rarely, yet effectively. He tries to  look for love and beauty in
things  that  seemingly  are  neither  lovely  nor beautiful. For
example,  when Billy  was captured  by the  group of  Germans, he
didn't see them as a cruel enemy, but as normal, innocent people.
"Billy looked up at the face that went with the clogs. It was the
face of a blond angel, of  a fifteen-year-old boy. The boy was as
beautiful as Eve." (Vonnegut 1969 p.53).
      An  interesting contrast  in  Vonnegut's  books is  the one
between  men and  women. Male  characters are  often engaging  in
fights and  wars, and females  try to prevent  them from it.  The
woman characters are often mentally strong, have strong will, and
are very humane and loving. A good example is Vonnegut's dialogue
in the first chapter, when he talks with his old friend O'Hare in
front of O'Hare's wife:

           Then she turned  to me, let me see  how angry she
    was, and that the anger was for me. She had been talking
    to herself,  so what she said  was a fragment of  a much
    larger  conversation. 'You  were just  <i>babies</i> then!' she
    said.
           'What?' I said.
           'You were  just babies in the  war--like the ones
    upstairs!'
           I nodded that this was  true. We <i>had</i> been foolish
    virgins in the war, right at the end of childhood.
           'But you're  not going to write  it that way, are
    you.' This wasn't a question. It was an accusation.
           'I - I don't know,' I said.
           'Well,  <i>I</i> know,'  she said.  'You'll pretend  you
    were men instead of babies,  and you'll be played in the
    movies by Frank Sinatra and  John Wayne or some of those
    other glamorous, war-loving, dirty old men. And war will
    look just wonderful,  so we'll have a lot  more of them.
    And  they'll  be  fought   by  babies  like  the  babies
    upstairs.'
           So then I understood. It was war that made her so
    angry.  She didn't  want  her  babies or  anybody else's
    babies killed in wars. And  she thought wars were partly
    encouraged by books and movies. (ibid p. 14-15)

Another place  where Vonnegut expresses  the previously mentioned
qualities  of women  is the  part  where  Billy becomes "slightly
unstuck in time" and watches the war movie backwards:

           When  the bombers  got  back  to their  base, the
    steel cylinders  were taken from  the racks and  shipped
    back to  the United States  of America, where  factories
    were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders,
    separating   the  dangerous   contents  into   minerals.
    Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. (ibid
    p.74-75).

In  reality,  of  course,  the  women  were  building the weapons
instead of dismantling them.
      The most often expressed theme  of the book, in my opinion,
is that we, people, are "bugs in amber." The phrase first appears
when Billy is kidnapped by the Tralfamadorian flying saucer:

           'Welcome   aboard,   Mr.   Pilgrim,'   said   the
    loudspeaker. 'Any questions?'
           Billy licked his lips,  thought a while, inquired
    at last: 'Why me?'
           'That is  a very <i>Earthling</i>  question to ask,  Mr.
    Pilgrim. Why <i>you</i>? Why <i>us</i>  for that matter? Why <i>anything</i>?
    Because this  moment simply <i>is</i>. Have  you ever seen bugs
    trapped in amber?'
           'Yes.' Billy,  in fact, had a  paperweight in his
    office  which was  a blob  of polished  amber with three
    lady-bugs embedded in it.
           'Well, here  we are, Mr. Pilgrim,  trapped in the
    amber of this moment. There is no <i>why</i>.' (ibid p.76-77).

This rather  extraterrestrial opinion can  be interpreted as  our
being  physically stuck  in this  world, that  we don't  have any
choice over what we, mankind as a whole, do and what we head for.
The only thing we can do  is think about everything, but we won't
affect  anything. This  idea  appears  many times  throughout the
novel. This is one of the examples, when  Billy proposes marriage
to Valencia:

           Billy didn't want to  mary ugly Valencia. She was
    one of the symptoms of his disease. He knew he was going
    crazy when  he heard himself proposing  marriage to her,
    when he begged  her to take the diamond  ring and be his
    companion for life, (ibid p.107).

This excerpt directly shows that  Billy didn't like Valencia very
much and that  he actually didn't want to  marry her. However, he
was "stuck in amber". Or, for  example, Billy knew the exact time
when he would be killed, yet  didn't try to do anything about it.
Anyway, he  couldn't have changed it.  The death bears comparison
with  mankind's fate.  The  main  thing Vonnegut  probably wanted
people to  think about has  something to do  with wars on  Earth.
Vonnegut says so in the part  where Billy discusses the pro blems
about wars  with the Tralfamadorians (p.117).  They tell him that
everything is structured the way it is and that trying to prevent
war on Earth is stupid. This means that there always will be wars
on Earth, that  we, people, are "designed" that  way. There might
be people  striving for eternal  peace, but those  people must be
very naive  and probably don't  know humankind's nature.  We know
that wars  are bad and  we would  like  to stop them,  but we are
"stuck in amber."
      This  point of  view also  might explain  why there  are no
villains or  heroes in Vonnegut's  books. According to  Ernest W.
Ranly, all  the characters are  "Comic, pathetic pieces,  juggled
about  by some  inexplicable  faith,  like puppets,"  (Riley 1974
p.454).  If  there  is  no-one  to  take  the  blame  for the bad
happenings in the book, it can  only mean that the villain is God
Himself  ("or Herself  or Itself  or Whatever"  - from Vonnegut's
<i>Hocus Pocus</i>,  1990). God Almighty had  to be the one   who put us
into the amber, who had created us the way we are.

           There are almost no characters in this story, and
    almost no  dramatic confrontations, because  most of the
    people  in  it  are  so  sick  and  so much the listless
    playthings of enormous forces, (Vonnegut 1969 p.164).

      Another theme of  the novel is that there  is no such thing
as a soldier. There is only a man, but never a soldier. A soldier
is  not a  human being   any more.  Vonnegut expresses  this most
obviously in this extract from the time when Billy was imprisoned
in Dresden:

           When the three fools  found the communal kitchen,
    whose  main job  was to  make lunch  for workers  in the
    slaughterhouse,  everybody had  gone home  but one woman
    who had been waiting for them impatiently. She was a war
    widow.  So it  goes. She  had her  hat and  coat on. She
    wanted to go home, too, even though there wasn't anybody
    there. Her  white gloves were  laid out side  by side on
    the zinc counter top.
           She had  two big cans of  soup for the Americans.
    It was  simmering over low  fires on the  gas range. She
    had stacks of loaves of black bread, too.
           She asked Gluck if he  wasn't awfully young to be
    in the army. He admitted that he was.
           She asked Edgar Derby if he wasn't awfully old to
    be in the army. He said he was.
           She asked  Billy Pilgrim what he  was supposed to
    be.  Billy said  he didn't  know. He  was just trying to
    keep warm.
           'All the  real soldiers are  dead,' she said.  It
    was true. So it goes, (Vonnegut 1969 p.159).

Stanley  Schatt said:  "Vonnegut opposes  any institution,  be it
scientific,  religious, or  political, that  dehumanizes man  and
considers him a  mere number and not a  human being," (Riley 1973
p.348)  and I  think that  this attitude  shows up  in many other
books by Kurt Vonnegut (<i>Player Piano, Hocus Pocus</i> etc.)
      Another  obvious  theme  of  the  book  is  that  death  is
inevitable and that  no matter who dies, life  still goes on. The
phrase "So it goes" recurs one  hundred and six times: it appears
everytime anybody  dies in the  novel, and sustains  the circular
quality  of the  book. It  enables the  book, and thus Vonnegut's
narration, to go on. It must  have been hard writing a book about
such an experience and it probably helped the author to look upon
death through the eyes of Tralfamadorians:

           When  a  Tralfamadorian  sees  a  corpse,  all he
    thinks is  that the dead  person is in  bad condition in
    the particular moment, but that  the same person is just
    fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear
    that somebody is  dead, I simply shrug and  say what the
    Tralfamadorians say  about dead people, which  is 'So it
    goes,' (ibid p.27).

<font size=+3><b>The Main Message of the novel</b></font>
      As you noticed, the  book has different messages; everybody
may see something else as its main meaning. I think that Vonnegut
wanted to tell  us, the readers, that no  matter what happens, we
should retain our humanity. We should not let anybody or anything
reign upon our personalities, be it  a god, be it a politician or
anybody else. We should be ourselves - human and humane beings.

           I  looked through  the Gideon  Bible in  my motel
    room for  tales of great destruction.  <i>The sun was risen
    upon the Earth when Lot entered into Zo-ar,</i> I read. <i>Then
    the Lord  rained upon Sodom and  upon Gomorrah brimstone
    and fire from Lord out of Heaven; and He overthrew those
    cities, and  all the plain,  and all the  inhabitants of
    the cities, and that which greaw upon the ground.</i>
           So it goes.
           Those were  vile people in both  those cities, as
    is well known. The world was better off without them.
           And Lot's  wife, of course, was  told not to look
    back where  all those people  and their homes  had been.
    But she <i>did</i> look back, and  I love her for that, because
    it was so human.
           So  she was  turned to  a pillar  of salt.  So it
    goes, (Vonnegut 1969 p.21-22).
