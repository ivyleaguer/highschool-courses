<b><u>CHAPTER I: Humanity</u></b>

       In this section, the character, Humanity, is going to
become a  subject to a thorough  literary analysis. Vonnegut
usually repeats himself over and  over again in defining and
describing  human  beings.  He  uses  similar  attributes of
Humanity throughout his books and stories. There is a number
of positive qualities that  Vonnegut often highlights in his
works, but these are mostly overruled by negative qualities.

<b>Physical appearance</b>
       It  has been  said that  Vonnegut's characters "still
bear more  of a resemblance to  cartoon figures than regular
human  beings"  (Kakutani:17).  Physical  appearance of most
Vonnegut's human characters is surprisingly very similar. He
makes all  the people in his  works appear ridiculous. Billy
Pilgrim,  the  main  character  of <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, "was
a funny-looking    child   who    became   a   funny-looking
youth--tall  and   weak,  and  shaped   like  a  bottle   of
Coca-Cola" (SH5:23). James Wait, one of the main chara cters
of <i>Galapagos</i>,  "was prematurely bald  and he was  pudgy, and
his  color was  bad, like  the  crust  on a  pie in  a cheap
cafeteria,  and  he  was  bespectacled"  (GAL:6).  The  main
character  of  <i>Bluebeard</i>  looked  like  a  "gunshot  iguana"
(BLU:12). The Swain twins, the main characters of <i>Slapstick,
</i>were not  very pretty either.  Their appearance may  be even
the worst  and most repulsive of  all Vonnegut's characters.
Wilbur Swain says that

         Eliza  and I  were so  ugly that  our parents  were
         ashamed.
              We were monsters, and  we were not expected to
         live very  long. We had six  fingers on each little
         hand, and  six toes on each  little footsie. We had
         supernumerary  nipples  as  well  --  two  of  them
         apiece.
              We  were not  mongolian idiots,  although we had
         the  coarse black  hair typical  of mongoloids,  We
         were something new. We were neanderthaloids. We had
         features  of  adult,  fossil  human  beings even in
         infancy -- massive  brow-ridges, sloping foreheads,
         and steamshovel jaws. (SLP:31)

      In addition  to this kind  of physical ugliness,  many
people in Vonnegut's  books are very fat or  even obese, for
example  Eliot Rosewater  (the main  character of  <i>God Bless
You,  Mr.  Rosewater</i>),  Rudy  Waltz  (the  main character of
<i>Deadeye Dick</i>), Ruth Starbuck (the wife of the main character
in <i>Jailbird</i>), professor Swain  (appearing in <i>Slapstick</i>), who
even  died of  it (SLP:40),  and many  more. The  obesity or
monstrous  fatness  accompanying  ugliness,  which  has been
described above, adds considerably to the mental picture the
reader forms in his mind during reading.
       Most  people   in  Vonnegut's  books   are  not  only
charm-free, cosmetically  challenged, vertically challenged,
horizontally  gifted (to  use politically  correct language)
etc.  because  they  were  not  given  from above, but their
bodies also look deteriorated by  their own doing, or should
be said, lack of doing  anything. Many of his characters are
described as  unwashed, unshaved, having oily  hair etc. The
ghost  of  Kilgore  Trout  (apparently  Vonnegut's  favorite
character),  for example,  is described  like th  is: "As in
life, he needed  a shave. As in life, he  was still pale and
haggard.  As  in  life,  he  was  still  smoking a cigarete"
(GAL:255).
       Another aspect by which  Vonnegut often rudicules his
characters is making them wear completely ludicrous or dirty
and  ragged  clothes.  Of  course,  they  are not constantly
dressed ridiculously  -- mostly just  in the most  important
situations.  For  example,  when  the  sci-fi writer Kilgore
Trout arrives  to Midland City  for the grand  opening of an
Arts  Center he  looks in  the mirror  and sees "a red-eyed,
filthy  old creature  who was  barefoot, who  had his  pants
rolled up to his knees"  (BOC:229). Another good example can
be the moment  when Walter F. Starbuck in  <i>Jailbird</i> is being
let out of prison and  he dresses into civillian clothes and
looks in the mirror. Here is who he saw:

         a scrawny old janitor of  Slavic extraction. He was
         unused  to  wearing  a  suit  and  a tie. His shirt
         collar was much  too large for him, and  so was his
         suit, which  fit him like a  circus tent. He looked
         unhappy--on  his  way   to  a  relative's  funeral,
         perhaps. At no point  was there any harmony between
         himself and the suit. He may have found his clothes
         in a rich man's ash can. (JAI:66)

The last example might be Otto Waltz applying to the Academy
of Fine Arts in Vienna. He

         was told to come back  to the Academy in two weeks,
         at  which time  they  would  tell him  whether they
         would take him or not.
              He was  in rags at  the time, with  a piece of
         rope for  a belt, and with  patched trousers and so
         on. (DED:4)

       It would  be wrong to  understand, however, that  all
people  in Vonnegut's  books are  looking dirty,  ragged and
ridiculous.  There are  a couple  of exceptions  when people
look nice and tidy and  beautiful. They are, however, mostly
minor  characters. If  there appears  a main  character that
does  not  look  ludicrous,  it  is  because  he/she has not
reached the point when Vonnegut decides to make him/her look
that  way. Beautiful  wives get  fat and  ugly (e.g.  Walter
Starbuck's  wife  Ruth  in  <i>Jailbird</i>),  succesful  people go
downhill and  end up in  rags (e.g. Malachi  Constant in <i>The
Sirens of Titan</i> or, again, W. Starbuck).
       Over all, to  get back to the idea  that all humanity
forms a  literary character, it can  be said that Vonnegut's
Humanity  has a  negative (even  repulsive) appearance. Even
though there appears a positive  quality every now and then,
these are  overwhelmed by the  majority of the  former ones.
Moreover,  Vonnegut  both  assigns  this  ludicrousness  and
ugliness  of Humanity  to both  the natural  causes and  the
Humanity's  neglect of  itself. However,  it seems  that the
former causes are more characteristic of H umanity.
       Of course,  it can be pointed  out that appearance is
not  everything,  that  what  a  person  looks  like  is not
important, that it is what  is inside that counts. One would
be right in pointing it  out. Even Vonnegut admits this when
Walter Starbuck talks  about body sizes. He says  that it is
an issue that

         I am  very  reluctant  to  discuss--because I don't
         want  to  give  them   more  importance  than  they
         deserve.  Body sizes  can be  remarkable for  their
         variations from  accepted norms, but  still explain
         almost  nothing about  the lives  led inside  those
         bodies. I  am small enough to  have been a coxwain,
         as I have already confessed. That explains nothing.
         And, by  the time Leland  Clewes came to  trial for
         perjury,  my wife,  although only  five feet  tall,
         weighed one  hundred and sixty pounds  or so. So be
         it. (JAI:70-71)

In contrast, however, Vonnegut seems  not to be reluctant to
discuss these  aspects of Humanity at  all. His descriptions
of Humanity's appearance is a rather common and bold feature
of his books. It appears that Vonnegut uses this effect only
to strenghten his argument about the state of Humanity. Even
though appearance is not important, it makes the reader feel
pity,  shame,  compassion,  contempt  or  other feelings for
Humanity.

<b>Names</b>
      The account  of the description of  Humanity would not
be complete without mentioning  names of the main characters
of  Vonnegut's  books.  Benjamin  DeMott  in  his  review of
<i>Deadeye Dick</i>, when discussing Vonnegut's norms, says that in
this  novel  "the  hero  is  sweet  and  hapless  and  bears
a silly-sounding  name" (DeMott,  1982:p.1). Silly-sounding,
funny, weird names appear throughout all Vonnegut's writing.
Rudy Waltz  is one of  them, but not  the only one.  Several
other names can be mentioned to  give a g eneral idea: Billy
Pilgrim (SH5), Rabo Karabekian  (BLU), Kilgore Trout, Eugene
Victor Debs (HOC) or Malachi  Constant (TIT). It is not only
that  the characters  are funny.  They have  funny names  as
well.

<b>Environment</b>
       Before  the  analysis  will  be  allowed to penetrate
deeper  into  the  nature  of  Humanity,  it is important to
describe  the  environment  in  which  Vonnegut's  character
Humanity  lives.  Indication  of  a  literary  character  by
environment often  helps the reader to  form a more complete
picture of the character and  it will certainly help in this
case as well.
      Environment, just  like the characters  themselves, is
very often interchangeable in  Vonnegut's writing. There are
stories and novels taking place in the same cities or towns,
and the places often  have similar attributes, qualities and
appearance.  Vonnegut's  seemingly  favorite  places are for
example  Illium,  Cohoes  or   Schenectady  (in  New  York),
Indianapolis, Midland City (in Ohio), or Cape Cod. Sale says
that

         <i>Slapstick</i>  opens with  a typical  Vonnegut cynicism
         about   America   having    become   a   place   of
         interchangeable parts, so  that Indianapolis, which
         "once had  a way of  speaking all its  own," now is
         "just  another someplace  where automobiles  live."
         (Sale:3)

       What is interesting, however, is that the environment
mostly reflects the poor  appearance of the characters. They
often  live  in  houses  or  apartments  that are in similar
condition as  their appearance. Kilgore  Trout, for example,
lived  in  a  poor  basement  apartment  in Cohoes, New York
(BOC:20). Walter F. Starbuck  in <i>Jailbird</i>, after having left
the prison, lives in one of the dirtiest hotels in New York,
in Hotel  Arapahoe. In <i>Deadeye Dick</i>  Vonnegut even calls the
house of Rudy  Waltz (and the house s  of some other people)
a "shitbox". Even a  multimillionnaire Eliot Rosewater (ROS)
moves  to a  small town  of Rosewater,  Indiana, to  live in
a small cramped office.
       Similarly as described in  the section about physical
appearance,  when a  person is  not living  in a decrepit or
cramped  house  or  apartment,  it  mostly  means  only that
he/she has  not started to  go downhill yet.  Rudy Walts has
not  always  lived  in  a  "shitbox".  Walter  F.  Starbuck,
similarly,  has  not  always  lived  in  a  dirty hotel room
either.   On  the   contrary:  these   people  were   mostly
"fabulously well-to-do", as Vonnegut often describes them.
       Humanity  as a  character also  lives in  a decrepit,
cramped,  dirty  old  house  --  the  Earth.  In perhaps all
Vonnegut's books he constantly  alludes to the Earth's being
heavily polluted and nearly destroyed. It is possible to see
the analogy in this: Humanity was "fabulously well-to-do" in
the beginning but it has taken the course downhill.

<b>The Fruit of Humanity's Existence</b>
       It  is  possible  now  to  proceed  to  perhaps  most
startling facts about Humanity revealed by Kurt Vonnegut. He
constantly criticizes  many vices thought  up or created  by
men.  There are  two vices  about which  Vonnegut gets  most
bitter: war (Vonnegut served  in one himself) and ecological
disaster.  "The  more  you  learn  about  people,  the  more
disgusted you'll become," says the ghost of Kilgore Trout to
the ghost  of his son Leon  Trout, who served in  the war of
Vietnam.

            "I would  have thought that  your being sent  by
         the  wisest  men  in  your  country, supposedly, to
         fight a nearly endless, thankless, horrifying, and,
         finally,  pointless  war,   would  have  given  you
         sufficient insight  into the nature  of humanity to
         last you throughout all eternity."

Kilgore Trout continues,

            "Need  I  tell  you  that  these  same wonderful
         animals,  of  which  you  apparently  still want to
         learn more and more, are  at this very moment proud
         as Punch to have weapons in place, all set to go at
         a moment's notice, guarranteed to kill everything?"
         (GAL:254)

These are not the only bitter words Vonnegut expresses about
the issue of wars, but  they may well suffice to demonstrate
the point. The same speech of a ghost to a ghost can be used
for illustrating Vonnegut's bitternes  about the latter vice
as well:

             "Need I  tell you that this  once beautiful and
         nourishing  planet  when  viewed  from  the air now
         resembles the  diseased organs of  poor Roy Hepburn
         when exposed at his  autopsy, and that the apparent
         cancers, growing for the  sake of growth alone, and
         consuming all and poisoning  all, are the cities of
         your beloved human beings?
             "Need I  tell you that these  animals have made
         such  a botch  of things  that they  can no  longer
         imagine decent  lives for their  own grandchildren,
         even, and  will consider it  a miracle if  there is
         anything  left  to  eat  or  enjoy  by the year two
         thousand, now only fourteen years away?" (GAL:254)

       Vonnegut,  however  does  not  criticize  only  these
things in modern society. There are many more targets of his
bitterness  and anguish,  e.g. racism,  jingoism, commercial
greed, slavery etc.

<b>Fatal Lusts</b>
       Vonnegut  presents  two  main  drives  of  Humanity's
misbehavior. He  calls these incentives  'monsters'. "Lions?
Tigers?" he asks. The answer is "no." He says that lions and
tigers are asleep most of the  time and that the monsters he
has in mind never sleep. He says that they inhabit our heads
and our minds.  They are "the arbitrary lusts  for gold" and
"girl's  underpants" (BOC:25).  Vonnegut often  writes about
one  more   monster  that  proves   to  be  as   dangerously
destructive as  the already mentioned  two. This monster  is
ambition. However, ambition seems to stand hand in hand with
greed for wealth.

<b>Money</b>
       Lust for  gold seems to  be the most  often expressed
lust of Humanity. Humanity's  greed for money appears almost
in all Vonnegut's novels. <i>God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater</i> opens
with this statement:

              A sum of money is  a leading character in this
         tale  about people,  just as  a sum  of honey might
         properly  be a  leading character  in a  tale about
         bees. (ROS:7)

A similar example may be found in <i>The Sirens of Titan</i>, where
the main  character looks at  his solar watch:  "He held his
watch to sunlight, letting it  drink in the wherewithal that
was to solar watches what money was to Earth men" (TIT:14).
       These   two   excerpts   certainly   illustrate   the
importance people assign to money. They assign more value to
money  and gold  than to  fellow human  beings. Compared  to
money, human beings lose their  value as Vonnegut points out
for  example   in  <i>Galapagos</i>,  when   Ecuador  undergoes  an
economical crisis:

              Ecuador,   after  all,   like  the   Galapagos
         Islands, was mostly lava and  ash, and so could not
         begin  to  feed  its  nine  million  people. It was
         bankrupt,  and so  could  no  longer buy  food from
         countries with plenty of topsoil, so the seaport of
         Guayaquil was  idle, and the  people were beginning
         to starve to death. Business was business. (GAL:23)

In <i>Deadeye Dick</i>, Midland City's population is entirely wiped
out by  an explosion of  a neutron bomb.  This weapon causes
death  of  all  living  beings  and  leaves all the property
untouched. Ironically, Vonnegut asks whether it matters that
all those  people died so suddenly.  "Since all the property
is  undamaged,  has  the  world  lost  anything  it  loved?"
(DED:34) "Wake up, you idiots! Whatever made you think paper
was so valuable?" (GAL:24) Vonnegut  cries this out as if in
agony over the people's blindness wi th greed and money, and
the readers  can hear this  outcry very often  thoughout his
works.
      In  a  short  play,  "The  Chemistry  Professor", when
talking  about earning  money, the  characters are  suddenly
"caught up in  a mad, slobbering war dance  about wealth. It
ends  in panting  exhaustion" (PSU:265).  Another character,
Kimberley is "sexually aroused by wealth" and starts singing
a silly song about money and stock. (PSU:265)
       The most outstanding exception is the novel <i>God Bless
You, Mr. Rosewater</i> which suggests  that there still are good
people in the  world, that even in a  world spoiled by greed
and money, there  is the possibility of doing  good by means
of money. A  man who managed to do  this was Eliot Rosewater
who took the inherited wealth and started helping people.

<b>Underpants</b>
       Another  thing  that  drives  human  beings is sexual
lust, Vonnegut says. He  suggests that people's inability to
control  their animal  drives  leads  the planet  into doom,
mostly by means of overpopulation.
       Mary   Hepburn,  one   of  the   main  characters  in
<i>Galapagos</i>,  describes, for  example, "how  easily a  teenage
virgin could be made pregnant by  the seed of a male who was
seeking sexual  release and nothing  else, who did  not even
like  her"  (GAL:124).  In  <i>Breakfast  of Champions</i> Vonnegut
points  out  that  most  countries  are  in such a miserable
condition that there  is no more space for  people they have
nothing  to  eat.  And  still   they  go  on  having  sexual
intercourse,  which is,  as Vonnegut  reminds us,  how babie
s are   made.   "More   babies   were   arriving   all   the
time--kicking and screaming, yelling for milk" (BOC:12-13).
       With  tongue  in  his   cheek,  Vonnegut  shows  that
'babies' is  a wonderful way  of overcoming wars,  that even
after  long lasting  wars there  still seem  to be plenty of
people  around  (GAL:33).  This,  however,  encourages  many
people  to think  of murdering,  wiping out  cities etc. "as
show    business,    as    highly    theatrical   forms   of
self-expression, and little more" (GAL:33).
       Humanity, evidently,  as Kurt Vonnegut  describes it,
is producing more than it can sustain, yet it is ignorant of
this fact. "Just because  something can reproduce, that does
not mean that it  should reproduce," (HOC:49) Vonnegut says.
Otherwise, Humanity could suffocate. The word "locusts" also
comes  into mind;  or "Planet  Gobblers", which  is a  short
story written by Kilgore Trout. The story was

         about us, and we were  the terrors of the universe.
         We were  sort of interplanetary  termites. We would
         arrive  on a  planet, gobble  it up,  and die.  But
         before  we died,  we sent  out spaceships  to start
         tiny colonies elsewhere... (PSU:209)

Humanity, however, does not realize that there is Earth only
and after it "gobbles up" this planet, there will be no more
food, no more planets to consume.

<b>Big brains</b>
       Vonnegut  does  not  only   describe  the  drives  of
Humanity, he even uncovers the  source of these lusts and of
all the  bad things Humanity does.  In <i>Galapagos</i>, the source
is  Humanity's  imagination,   destructive  ideas,  people's
oversized brains.  "If catastrophe comes more  easily to man
than courtesy  and decency," <i>Contemporary  Authors</i> suggests,
"man's large  brain is to  blame" (<i>Contemporary Authors</i>,49).
"Can  it be  doubted that  three kilogram  brains were  once
nearly fatal  defects in the  evolution of the  human race?"
(GAL:8)  Vonnegut  asks.  He  asserts  that  the  planet  is
basically innocent,  "except for those  big brains" (GAL:9).
These   brains  are   "irresposible,  unreliable,  hideously
dangerous, wholly unrealistic" and  they are "simply no damn
good" (GAL:25).
       These brains  make people lie,  for example (GAL:67).
They are the "irresponsible  generators of suggestions as to
what might be done with  life" (GAL:78). They generate crazy
ideas in the heads of human beings who cannot help but carry
them  out.  Vonnegut  calls  this  aspect  of  human  brains
"diabolical" (GAL:266).

             They would  tell their owners,  in effect 'Here
         is a  crazy thing we  could actually do,  probably,
         but we would never do  it, of course. It's just fun
         to think about.'
             And  then,  as  though  in  trances, the people
         would really do it--have slaves fight each other to
         the Death in the Colloseum, or burn people alive in
         the public  square for holding  opinions which were
         locally  unpopular, or  build factories  whose only
         purpose   was   to   kill   people   in  industrial
         quantities, or to blow up  whole cities, and on and
         on. (GAL:266)

       Even Kilgore Trout realizes in <i>Breakfast of Champions</i>
that evil  is put into  the world in  the form of  bad ideas
(BOC:15).  Furthermore, Vonnegut  illustrates the  danger of
wild  ideas on  the saying  "If wishes  were horses, beggars
would  ride." He  shows that  since people  discovered tools
(and  weapons,  consequently)  "the  homicidal beggars could
ride" (BOC:28). In simpler  words, Humanity's brains managed
to make people's wishes (crazy ideas etc.) come true.

<b>Suicidal Tendencies</b>
      A rather  common tendency that Humanity  seems to have
in Vonnegut's  works are suicidal tendencies.  How often the
reader  encounters characters  who die  prematurely of their
own will.  So often, the  bad ideas in  people's brains make
them do such a horrible thing as commit suicide.
      In  <i>Timequake</i>,  Vonnegut  says  that  people  are  the
smartest  animals on  the planet,  who "hate  being alive so
much." (TQK:5)  In "Welcome to the  Monkey House", there are
so called suicide parlors, where people can kill themselves,
or rather have themselves killed in  a humane way, by a nice
woman,  with  a  last  meal,  with  pleasant atmosphere etc.
(WTM:28-47)
      A rather common manner of  ending one's life is eating
Drano,  a  poisonous  chemical  normally  used  for cleaning
drains. Celia Hoover, the wife of one of the main characters
of <i>Breakfast of Champions</i>  and <i>Deadeye Dick</i>, commits suicide
this way.  (DED:190) Drano appears also  in Vonnegut's later
books as  a succesful tool  of deliberate self  destruction.
Vonnegut also writes that  the Earth itself, Humanity itself
looked as if it were eating this chemical.

              The  planet itself  was breaking  down. It was
         going to blow itself up  sooner or later anyway, if
         it  didn't  poison  itself  first.  In  a manner of
         speaking, it was already eating Drano. (DED:197)

<b>Stupidity</b>
      From  reading Vonnegut,  one can  easily conclude that
Vonnegut  intends  to  show  that  people  are  stupid, that
Humanity  as  a  whole  is  stupid,  dumb and ignorant. With
several characters the writer takes  it to the extreme, such
as  Kimberley  in  the  "Chemistry  Professor".  The  play's
commentary   calls  her   "scatterbrained"  (PSU:261),   but
stupidity could  be the image the  reader forms when reading
about  her going  to look  up an  unimportant comment in the
library, a comment  that has been uttered just  by the w ay,
and  even more  when, after  a few  pages, Kimberley  enters
again and  asks innocently "Which building  is the library?"
(PSU:268) Others, more important  characters, may be seen as
stupid  as well.  Howard, for  example, sees  Billy (SH5) as
"a vaguely dissatisfied dupe," and  adds that "he is a blank
and stupid  man" (Howard:133). In <i>Cat's  Cradle</i> Bokonon says
that  he  could  write  a  whole  book,  "a history of human
stupidity" and use it for a pillow (CAT:191).
      In <i>Hocus  Pocus</i>, ignorance, conceit  and dumbness show
up  to  be  the  most  frequently  pin-pointed  problems  of
Humanity.  The  main  character,  Eugene  Debs  Hartke,  for
example, speaks about a Jack Patton who was

         against everybody's reproducing, since human beings
         were, in  his own words, "about  1,000 times dumber
         and meaner than they think they are."
              I myself, obviously,  have finally come around
         to his point of view. (HOC:49)

Later, Hartke continues and says:

              I  think  that  William  Shakespeare  was  the
         wisest human being I ever heard of. To be perfectly
         frank,  though,  that's  not  saying  much.  We are
         impossibly conceited animals,  and actually dumb as
         a heck. Ask any teacher. You don't even have to ask
         a teacher. Ask  anybody. Dogs and  cats are smarter
         than we are. (HOC:146)

He  continues with  the outpour  of his  heart and calls the
board of Trustees of  Tarkington College dummies, people who
caused  the  war  in  Vietnam  dummies  and even himself the
"biggest dummy of all" (HOC:146).
      From  the several  examples shown  above, it  is clear
that  Vonnegut  does  not  have   a  very  high  opinion  of
humankind,  but rather  a contemptuous  one. Bryant  notices
that "Vonnegut cites human stupidity and the human condition
as the two chief obstacles to the achievement of the highest
good,"  and that  it is  human stupidity  "that leads men to
kill and cheat and steal" (Bryant:323) .

<b>Machines</b>
       Another  quality  of  Humanity  corresponds  with the
above  described  stupidity.  This   quality  is  seen  when
Vonnegut describes people as machines. The impulses by which
the reader forms the image of Humanity as a machine are both
direct and  indirect. In <i>Sirens  of Titan</i> Vonnegut  explains
the term machine.  In his opinion, to be a  machine is to be
vulgar,  to  lack  sensitivity  and  imagination,  and to be
"purposeful without a shred  of conscience" (TIT:200). These
traits, or  most of them, can  be recognize d in  most human
characters in Vonnegut's books.
      Humanity's   vulgarity   is   obvious   from   perhaps
everything Vonnegut  has written: from  how people talk  and
how they act, from their 'animal' attitude towards sexuality
etc.
      Lack of sensitivity is also  a very often used quality
of  humans. Vonnegut  demonstrates  this  by many  ways: the
previously   mentioned  Humanity's   attitude  towards   sex
(lacking sesitivity altogether), human greed (people are not
stopped by anything in their  chase for silver and gold) and
the omnipresent shadow of war,  when people forget the value
of human life altogether and turn into "homicidal imbeciles"
(HOC:3).
      That  people  are  purposeful  is  also  a  very often
expressed  quality of  humans. People  keep doing  what they
seem  to be  programmed for,  what they  seem to be designed
for. One  of these purposes is  surely the already mentioned
reproduction. An example of this  can be found, for example,
in <i>Deadeye Dick</i>:

              The  actress playing  Celia could  ask why God
         had even put her on Earth.
              And  then  the  voice  from  the  back  of the
         theater could  rumble: 'To reproduce.  Nothing else
         really  interests Me.  All the  rest is  frippery.'
         (DED:185)

Another  aspect of  Vonnegut's novels  that can  hint at the
issue  of  purposefulness,  is  people  being  reduced  into
unthinking  entities  by  various  institutions.  People are
often seen  as robots under orders,  willing to do anything.
One of  the most often described  institutions is surely the
army. For  example, the main  character in <i>Hocus  Pocus</i> says
that he was a professional soldier and would have killed the
returning  Jesus Christ  if  ordered  by a  superior officer
(HOC:2). In <i>Sirens of Titan</i>   Vonnegut describes soldiers as
people with antennae in their  heads, controlled by radio to
do anything the commander chooses (TIT:63).
      The  only exception  from  the  traits of  'a machine'
applied to Humanity is the lack of imagination. It cannot be
said  that Vonnegut's  characters lack  imagination. On  the
contrary,  human  imagination  is  often  emphasized.  It is
a very important quality of Vonnegut's Humanity.
       This   chapter  has   so  far   dealt  with  indirect
indications of people's being  machines. However, this trait
is also very often defined in the text directly. This direct
definition is perhaps most common in <i>Breakfast of Champions</i>.
One of the  Kilgore Trout's books, Now It  Can Be Told, says
that all people, all living things are machines and the only
entity with free will is  the reader of the book (BOC:173-5,
253-7).  Another  example  is  people  being  seen  from the
viewpoint of Tralfamadorians (Vonnegu t's favorite 'race' of
aliens).  These  beings  see  everything  what happens, what
happened and what will happen, at the same time.

              Lionel Merble was  a machine. Tralfamadorians,
         of course, say that every creature and plant in the
         Universe is a machine. It  amuses them that so many
         Earthlings  are  offended  by  the  idea  of  being
         machines.
              Outside the plane,  the machine named Valencia
         Merble Pilgrim  was eating a  Peter Paul Mound  Bar
         and waving bye-bye. (SH5:154)

Another way of direct definition  of this character trait is
considering  the parts  of human  body to  be components  of
a machine. Talking  about anatomy Vonnegut  often uses words
like wires, motors, switches, computers etc. (e.g. BOC:3).
      The idea of pre-programmed human being appears also in
<i>Timequake</i>, where Vonnegut suggests that its genes which make
us behave in this or that way (TQK:118). Genes are some kind
of  programming of  human  beings,  they cannot  be changed.
No-one  chooses  genes,  they  are  inherited.  A child gets
his/her  genes  at  conception  and  has  to  live with them
through  the  rest  of  his/her  life.  This also may allude
humans to machines.
       To  sum up,  Vonnegut argues  that "human  beings are
robots,  are  machines"  (BOC:3).  He  both  indicates  this
directly and indirectly. Vonnegut  also provides a 'formula'
(defining the  term 'machine') by  which the reader  can see
this  by  him/herself  (TIT:200).  There  is,  however,  one
element  in the  formula, into  which the  image of humanity
does not fit. This element is human imagination.

<b>Family life</b>
      The  last  feature  that  needs  to  be discussed when
describing Vonnegut's humanity is the appearance of families
in  the novels.  Vonnegut's families  seem to  be undergoing
a crisis, just  as everything about  Humanity that has  been
described so far.
      People  often say  that family  is the  basis of every
state and every human society.  Should family be broken, the
society would break as well.  The problems would start among
the young  people, but then,  as they would  grow up, become
the heads of their own families and have their own children,
the problems would appear among their posterity as well: the
brokenness spreading from generation  to generation. This is
exactly what is happening  in Vonnegut's writing. The family
in  Vonnegut's  books  just  se  ems  not  to work properly.
Especially  the relationship  between father  and son  often
fails to function correctly.
      Kilgore Trout  can be one  of the examples.  His three
marriages failed and his son,  Leon, ran away from home when
he was  sixteen. It was "because  I was so ashamed  of him,"
Leon  explains  the  reason  (GAL:255).  "When  I  got to be
sixteen, though,  I myself had arrived  at the conclusion my
mother and  the neighbors had  reached so long  ago: that my
father was a repellent failure, ... He was an insult to life
itself..."  (GAL:256).   Kilgore  Trout  had   a  depressing
childhood, too  (BOC:31). Another example  of not very  good
relationship  between father  and children  can be  found in
<i>Bluebeard</i>, where the main character, Rabo Karabekian says:

              One might  think that my  two sons, Terry  and
         Henri Karabekian,  . . .,  might enjoy coming  here
         with their families. Terry has  two sons of his own
         now. Henri has a daughter..
              But they do not speak to me.
              'So be it! So be  it!' I cry in this manicured
         wilderness.  'Who   gives  a  damn!'   Excuse  this
         outburst." (BLU:6)

      <i>Deadeye   Dick</i>   also   shows   the   reader  (in  the
relationship between the main character and his father) that
an unsuccessful father can only produce an unsuccessful son.
In  this  case,  the  father  is  a  painter,  a  failure of
a painter,  actually,  and  the  son  becomes an unsuccesful
writer.  The  fact  that  parents   pass  a  great  part  of
themselves on their posterity is demostrated or mentioned in
many of  Vonnegut's books. In <i>Hocus  Pocus</i>, for example, the
main character says:

         And  if  I  feel  that  my  father  was  a  horse's
         fundament  and my  mother was  a horse's fundament,
         what can I be but another horse's fundament? Ask my
         kids, both legitimate  and illegitimate. They know.
         (HOC:146)

To mention another example, the  fact that Kilgore Trout was
not  very successful  caused the  same in  his son, who "was
flunking every course but arts at school" (GAL:256).
      <i>Bluebeard</i> shows another problem in the family: members
of a  family not caring  about one another:  the husband not
caring about his wife and wife not caring about her husband.

         "...my Mother, who let  herself become quite heavy,
         and who didn't care much what her hair looked like,
         either, or her clothes.  Mother didn't care because
         Father didn't care." (BLU:14)

      There are  more family problems,  such as divorce  and
child  abuse in  Vonnegut's books,  but there  is no need to
examine them in detail.
      As a result of malfunctioning families, Humanity often
experiences and  suffers from loneliness.  Vonnegut realizes
the need  for a family.  "Human beings are  genetically such
gregarious  creatures,"  he  says.   "They  need  plenty  of
like-minded  friends and  relatives almost  as much  as they
need  B-complex   vitamins  and  a   heartfelt  moral  code"
(PSU:204). He  uses a Christian saying  "One Christian is no
Christian." and changes  it to "One human being  is no human
being." (PSU:216). Wilbur Swain speaks in Slap stick with an
old lonely man:

              An  old man  crawled up  to me  afterwards and
         told  me  how  he  used  to  buy life insurance and
         mutual   funds   and   household   appliances   and
         automobiles and so on, not because he liked them or
         needed  them, but  because the  salesman seemed  to
         promise to be his relative, and so on.
              "I had  no relatives and  I needed relatives,"
         he said.
              "Everybody does," I said.
              He told  me he had  been a drunk  for a while,
         trying  to make  relatives out  of people  in bars.
         "The  bartender  would  be  kind  of  a father, you
         know-" he said. "And all of a sudden it was closing
         time." (SLP:125-126)

Vonnegut also shows that loneliness  might be the reason for
the bad things  in the world: "all the  damaging excesses of
Americans in  the past were  motivated by loneliness  rather
than a fondness for sin" (SLP:125).

<b>Summing up Humanity</b>
      This part of the essay  has shown the overall image of
Humanity  in  Vonnegut's  books.  It  has  illustrated  that
Humanity   (as  a   literary  character)   is  ugly,  dirty,
funny-looking,  fat  and  is  definitely  not  "going to win
a beauty contest"  (SLP:51). It has  been born with  some of
these  qualities, and  the  others  were caused  by Humanity
neglecting itself. The environment,  where Humanity lives is
as  miserable  as  its  physical  appearance:  the Earth has
turned into a cramped,  neglected, dirty, smelly place.These
negative  qualities  are,  however,  strongly overpowered by
'inner'  qualities. Humanity  is  seen  as a  machine moving
incontrollably  forward,  driven  by  several  'fatal lusts'
(such  as greed  for money  and wealth,  ambition, sex). The
machine never stops, decency is unimportant, human lives are
unimportant.   The   'monster'   moves   onward,  destroying
everything that  gets in its way.  However, the machine also
seems  to be  driven by  a much  higher force,  by something
completely out of Humanity's control.
