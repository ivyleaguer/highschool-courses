<b>Kilgore Trout: Kurt Vonnegut's Alter Ego</b>
Stephanie E. Bonner                    

      In 1922,  two residents of Indianapolis,  Indiana had a son
who  would  later  become  one  of  the  premiere writers in 20th
century American literature. Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. was born to Edith
and Kurt Sr.  on November 11, 1922. He  graduated from Shortridge
High School in 1940, attended Cornell University for a year, then
joined the  army. He fought in  World War II and  was captured by
the Germans in  1944. As a Prisoner of War,  he lived through the
firebombing  of Dresden,  an event  which inspired  his acclaimed
novel,  <u>Slaughterhouse-Five.</u>  After  he  returned from  Europe in
April of 1945, he married Jane  Marie Cox and spent several years
studying at the  University of Chicago and working  as a reporter
for the  Chicago City News  Bureau. In 1947,  he went to  work at
General Electric Corporation as  a research laboratory publicist.
He worked there  for 3 years until he left  to become a full time
writer in  1950. In the past  47 years, he has  become one of the
most acclaimed writers of our time.
      Kurt Vonnegut's  first novel was entitled  <u>Player Piano</u> and
was published  in 1952. Since then,  he has written over  a dozen
other  novels,  collections  of  short  stories,  a collection of
essays and interviews, and a  play, <u>Happy Birthday Wanda June</u>. He
spent  1965  in  residence  at  the  University  of Iowa Writer's
Workshop  and taught  writing at   Harvard in  1970. He  also was
awarded a  M.A. degree from  the University of  Chicago. Vonnegut
currently appears on the Barnes  and Noble Booksellers bag and is
featured  on a Visa commercial in which  he buys a copy of one of
his own books.
      If one  looks through Vonnegut's works,  one will find many
occurrences  of  reoccurring  characters,  settings,  and themes.
Perhaps  one  of  the  most  frequently  occurring  characters is
Kilgore Trout, an obscure science-fiction writer with a small but
devoted following of readers. Though  the details of Trout's life
change  from book  to book,  in all  of the  books he has written
a huge number  of short stories  and novels, but  has had trouble
getting  reputable publisher  to print  them. However,  there are
many  similarities between  Vonnegut and  Trout. The  reoccurring
character  Kilgore  Trout  mirrors  Vonnegut  himself through the
similarities in their lives, writings, and themes.
      The  life of  Kilgore Trout  changes from  book to book. In
<u>Jailbird</u>, he was serving a  life sentence in prison (Vonnegut 21)
In <u>Breakfast of  Champions</u>, he lives alone with  a parakeet named
Bill (Vonnegut 18),  while in <u>Galapagos</u>, he had a  wife and a son
(Vonnegut 42). In some books, like <u>Breakfast of Champions</u> and <u>God
Bless You,  Mr. Rosewater</u>, he rise  into fame by the  end, but in
others,  he dies  an unknown.  However, a  few factors remain the
same in  all of the books.  He always has written  a phenomenally
large number  of works, but  his works aren't  accepted by normal
publishers.  Thus,  while  Trout  labors  as  some sort of manual
worker  to  earn  money,  his  stories  are  printed as filler in
pornographic  magazines, though  the stories  themselves are  far
from  obscene.  By  the  time  of  the  action  in  <u>Breakfast  of
Champions</u>, Trout  had written 117 novels  and 2000 short stories,
yet still  worked as "an installer  of aluminum combination storm
windows and screens" (Vonnegut 18)
      Though  in some  ways, the  life of  Kurt Vonnegut  is very
different  from that  of Kilgore  Trout, there  are some  amazing
parallels. Though  Vonnegut has not written  nearly as many works
as Trout, both  have written a large number  of stories, and most
of  them are  science fiction.  Near the  end of  his life in his
<u>Breakfast  of Champions</u>  persona, Trout  had become  a famous and
acclaimed  person who  had won  a Nobel  Prize and  had become so
respectable  that  even  his   jokes  were  taken  seriously  and
incorporated into the language  (Vonnegut, <u>Breakfast of Champions</u>
25).  When Vonnegut  began publishing  works, though  respectable
publishers  did  accept  them,  they  were  printed  as paperback
originals, "the form that pulp fiction done by hack writers often
takes"  (Mustazza xxii).  It wasn't  until the  mid '60's that he
began to  take his place  in the literary  world (Mustazza xxii).
Though Trout  started at a  more extreme low  and rose to  a more
extreme high, Trout's rise to fame mirrored that of Vonnegut.
     Similarities  between  Vonnegut  and  Trout  appear  in  the
storyline  of their  writings as  well. Several  stories Vonnegut
attributes  to Kilgore  Trout  appear  someplace else  written by
Vonnegut himself. Perhaps  the best example of this  is the Trout
story called  "2BRO2B." In "2BRO2B,"  which appears in  <u>God Bless
You, Mr.  Rosewater</u>, Trout created  a world where  almost all the
work was done by machines, and humans could only get work if they
had several Ph.D.'s. (20) This world is remarkably similar to the
one where Vonnegut  set <u>Player Piano</u>, his first novel. The action
in <u>Player Piano</u> takes place on a world where almost everything is
done  by  machine,  and  the  machines  themselves "are no longer
controlled by men but by other machines" (Broer 18).
      The people in "2BRO2B" are so hopeless, and the world is so
overpopulated, that  the government has  set up a  "purple-roofed
Ethical Suicide  Parlor at every  major intersection, right  next
door to  an orange-roofed Howard  Johnson's" (Vonnegut, <u>God Bless
You, Mr.  Rosewater</u> 20). The  visitors to the  Suicide Parlor die
painlessly and  patriotically, and even  get a free  last meal at
the Howard  Johnson's next door  (21). In Vonnegut's  short story
"Welcome  to  the  Monkey  House"  the story  opens in an Ethical
Suicide   Parlor  almost  identical  to  the  ones  described  in
"2BRO2B," right down to the  purple roof and the Howard Johnson's
next door  (<u>Welcome to the  Monkey House</u> 32)  By actually writing
stories that he had earlier attributed to Kilgore Trout, Vonnegut
emphasizes the similarities between the two.
      In  Kurt Vonnegut's  works, fragments  of short  stories or
novels  attributed to  Kilgore Trout  often appear.  As Marek Vit
says, "the  themes of these  fragments are often  very similar to
the themes of Kurt Vonnegut's novels." One of the main themes the
two share is dehumanization. For example, <u>Player Piano</u> deals with
a world where almost everything is done by machines, causing most
humans  to become  useless  and  hopeless. Several  Kilgore Trout
stories related in the Kurt Vonnegut novel <u>Breakfast of Champions</u>
share  this theme.  One, appearing  on  page  73, is  set on  the
Hawaiian Islands:

           "Every bit  of land on  the islands was  owned by only
     about  forty  people,  and,  in  the  story, Trout had those
     people decide to exercise their property rights to the full.
     They put no trespassing signs on everything."
           "This created terrible problems  fro the million other
     people on the islands. The law of gravity required that they
     stick somewhere  on the surface. Either  that, or they could
     go out into the water and bob offshore."

      Eventually,  someone hits  on the  idea of  giving everyone
a helium  balloon  so  they  can  hover  over the islands without
actually  touching  the  ground.  However,  the  residents of the
island are dehumanized by money  and property rights to the point
where they can no longer even walk on the ground.
      Individuality is another theme that both Trout and Vonnegut
use. In  <u>Breakfast of Champions</u>,  there is a character named Rabo
Karabekian. Rabo Karabekian is  an abstract expressionist painter
who's paintings consist of canvases covered in one shade of paint
with stripes of colored tape on  it. When defending his works, he
describes the stripes of tape thus:

           "It is  the immaterial core...the 'I  am' to which all
     messages are sent.  It is all that is alive  in any of us...
     It  is  unwavering  and  pure,  no  matter what preposterous
     adventure  may befall  us... Our  awareness is  all that  is
     alive and maybe sacred in any  of us. Everything about us is
     dead machinery." (221)

      In this,  Vonnegut states that our  awareness is what makes
us human and makes us individuals  (Broer 105). In the same book,
Vonnegut relates  another Kilgore Trout  story, entitled "Now  It
Can Be Told."  The story is formatted as an  open letter from the
Creator  of  the  Universe  to  a  Creature  he  had  made  as an
experiment  in Life.  In the  story, this  creature was  the only
actual  living  being  on  earth,  and  everyone else were merely
robots programed so  that the Creator could see  how the Creature
would   react  to different  things. The  Creator was continually
being  surprised  by  the  way  the  Creature  reacted to things.
Because the Creature had free  will, the Creator couldn't predict
what  it would  do (173-175).  The entire  Trout story dealt with
what  makes  one  a  human,  an  individual.  Thus, like the Rabo
Karabekian's speech written by  Vonnegut, the Kilgore Trout story
deals with individuality.
      Marek Vit calls Trout "a  parody of Kurt Vonnegut himself."
James  Lundquist says  that he  is Vonnegut's  "alter ego"  (41).
Lawrence  Broer  dubs  Trout  Vonnegut's  "fictional counterpart"
(102). The  basic life of Kilgore  Trout reflects Vonnegut's, and
the two share the some of  the same writings. The basic themes of
both Kurt Vonnegut's  actual works and the ones  he attributes to
Trout are  the same. Kilgore  Trout, in many  ways, truly is  the
parody,  the  alter  ego,  the  fictional  counterpart,  of  Kurt
Vonnegut himself.
