<b>The Rise and Fall of Idealism</b></center>
Chris Hale

     Kurt Vonnegut  was greatly influenced by  his involvement in
World War  II. His entanglement  with the Dresden  bombing had an
unequivocal effect upon his  mentality, and the horrid experience
propelled the  liberal anti-war assertions that  dominate many of
his  novels.  Throughout  his  life,  his  idealistic  nature has
perceptibly undulated, and  five representative novels illustrate
the  forceful progression  and gradual  declivity of  his liberal
views.

     The first thirty years of  his life outwardly coincided with
the average American man. He was born in Indianapolis on November
11, 1922,  and lived a happy  childhood with a stable  family. He
then proceeded to pursue science in college, serve his country in
World War  II, study under  the GI Bill  after the war,  and land
a job  in public  relations before  becoming a  full-time writer.
Even  his large  and growing  family seemed  to capture  the true
spirit of the American ideal.

     However, one element  of his past would affect  him in a way
that  would change  his life  forever. In  December 1944,  he was
captured by  the Germans at the  Battle of the Bulge.  He and his
fellow  POWs were  taken to   Dresden, an  "open" city  rich with
architectural treasures and devoid of any military value. British
and American  planes needlessly firebombed the  city on the night
of February 13, 1945, hoping to inspire terror in the Germans and
crush  their   fighting  spirit.  Over   135,000  civilians  were
killed-twice the  amount of casualties  at Hiroshima. The  insane
horror and absurdity of the Dresden attack remained deeply etched
into Vonnegut's mind from that day forward.

     Nearly two decades later,  Vonnegut  published <i>Mother Night</i>,
a novel that  displays the profound  influence that the  massacre
exerted  upon  him.  It  contains  this stirring autobiographical
account of his Dresden experience in its preface:

         We didn't get  to see the fire storm. We  were in a cool
         meat-locker under the slaughterhouse with our six guards
         and ranks and ranks of dressed cadavers of cattle, pigs,
         horse and  sheep. We heard  the bombs walking  around up
         there. Now  and then there  would be a  gentle shower of
         calcimine. If we had gone above to take a look, we would
         have  been  turned   into  artifacts  characteristic  of
         firestorms:  seeming pieces  of charred  firewood two or
         three  feet  long-ridiculously  small  human  beings, or
         jumbo fried grasshoppers, if you will (page vi).

Although  this introductory  passage is  a graphically horrifying
chronicle of his life, it does  not precede a novel that utilizes
the  experience.   Vonnegut  did  not  even   insert  the  famous
introduction until four years later,  when the novel was reissued
as a hardcover original. Throughout the entirety of <i>Mother Night</i>,
he simply reacts to the absurdities of Nazi Germany as any common
American  would.  The  novel   does  not  unleash  his  ferocious
satirical  ability upon  the principles  of war,  and it does not
reveal his liberal mentality as well as many of his later novels.

     In 1963,  Vonnegut published the acclaimed  <i>Cat's Cradle</i>. In
this  work, he  attempts to  deal with  questions relating to the
social forces of  man: Where does mankind stand  in the universe?
How effective  is it in taking  care of itself? In  an attempt to
answer   these   questions,   he   creates   a   religion  called
"Bokononism," and the doctrine's basis is found in its "Genesis":

         In the  beginning, God created  the earth and  He looked
         upon it in His cosmic loneliness.

         And God said, "Let Us  make living creatures out of mud,
         so the mud  can see what We have  done." And God created
         every living creature that now  moveth, and one was man.
         Mud as man alone could speak. God leaned close as mud as
         man sat up, looked around, and spoke. Man blinked, "What
         is the purpose of all this?" he asked politely.

         "Everything must have a purpose?" asked God.

         "Certainly," said man.

         "Then I leave  it to you to think of  one for all this,"
         said God. And He went away (page 177).

This passage  displays Vonnegut's seemingly  cosmic observance of
humanity, and exposes a side of  him that was not detected in his
previous  novel.  He  uses  mankind's  discomforting  search  for
"purpose" to  illustrate a bitter  yet innovative concept  of the
human race. In  <i>Cat's Cradle</i>, he attributes the  end of the world
to ice-nine,  a freezing agent  that is needlessly  developed for
the United  States Marines. Ironically,  the apocalyptic chemical
is spread  by the children of  a renown scientist who  had helped
develop the  Hiroshima bomb. Using  this plot, Vonnegut  daringly
ridicules  humanity's  tragic  desire  for  war,  and the liberal
assertions in  <i>Cat's Cradle</i> reveal a  noticeable progression from
the relatively mundane views found in <i>Mother Night</i>.

     Six  years  later,  at  the  height  of  the Vietnam War, he
published <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, which fully unleashed the powerful
vision of the unbelievable annihilation  of Dresden that had been
behind  all his  work. The  1969 novel  signifies his realization
that the  importance of the World  War II experience was  not the
firebombing  itself but  his own  reaction to  it. This awareness
became apparent  during a speech  at Iowa City  when he described
the circumstances in which he wrote the novel:

         I came home  in 1945, starting writing  about (the war),
         and wrote about it, and  wrote about it, and wrote about
         it.  This thin  book is  about what  it's like  to write
         a book  about a  thing like  that. I  couldn't get  much
         closer. I  would head myself  into my memory  of it, the
         circuit breakers would kick out;  I'd head in again, I'd
         back off. The book is a  process of twenty years of this
         sort   of  living   with  Dresden   and  the   aftermath
         (Klinkowitz and Lawler 29).

With these words, he explains  the substantial influence that his
Dresden  experience had  on the  novel. As  one critic  explains,
"(<i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>) is  a novel about a  novelist who has been
unable  to erase  the memory  of his  wartime experience  and the
Dresden fire-storm, even while he  has been inventing stories and
fantasies  in his  role as  a writer  since the  end of  the war"
(Tanner 125).

     Evidently,  Vonnegut  views  his  own  role  as  a writer in
a dramatically different way in  this novel. Unlike <i>Cat's Cradle</i>,
his  assertions are  much more  bold, insinuating  the idea  that
mankind is  hopeless. In <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, the  reader is told
that  because of  the horrors  of war,  Billy Pilgrim  finds life
meaningless  and  therefore  tries  to  reinvent  himself and his
universe. Furthermore,  Billy is portrayed  as a caged  animal on
a different planet,  living in a  zoo as if  on display. One  may
wonder  what  idea  Vonnegut  is  attempting  to convey with this
aspect  of the  plot. As   one critic  attempts to  explain, "One
conclusion could  be that, as  a species, human  beings should be
caged,  studied, and  advised by  a higher  order of  life before
being set loose in the universe again. Or, perhaps, another would
be  that  they  must  stop  driving  themselves  mad  with  wars"
(Richardson  4074).  No  matter  the  answer, Vonnegut's anti-war
mentality  is  blatantly  conspicuous  in <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>. No
other  novel, whether  written prior  or subsequent  to the work,
exhibits his idealistic views so forcefully.

     This fact is clearly proven  in his next novel, <i>Breakfast of 
Champions</i>, which he wrote in 1971. Since he had finished his "war
book," he wrote in the opening chapter of <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, he
promised  himself that  his next   novel was  "going to  be fun."
However, the  time in which  he wrote <i>Breakfast  of Champions</i> was
plagued with anxiety.  He grew weary of the  critical acclaim and
stunning success stimulated by the prior novel, and he was afraid
that  his  next  book   would  disappoint  his  eagerly  awaiting
audience. As a result, he delayed publication until 1973 and even
included  his own  negative review  of the  novel in its preface,
stating that he felt "lousy about it" (page 4).

     Without doubt, <i>Breakfast of  Champions</i> is entirely different
from his past works. As  one critic explains, "Here Vonnegut does
not protest the social attitudes that lead to wars and ultimately
to  Dresden;  instead,  he  explores  the  possibility  that  our
attitudes are  irrelevant to such  events" (Merrill 155).  In his
attempt to be pessimistically  "fun," Vonnegut purposely deviates
from the focused  mentality that is clearly prevalent  in many of
his  past  novels.  He  digresses  upon  a  variety  of different
subjects,  ranging  from  the  national  anthem  to the idea that
Columbus  discovered America.  As a  result, he  does not clearly
display  the  anti-war  views  found in <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> and <i>Cat's Cradle</i>.

     Vonnegut's sense of idealism  made an even larger transition
in the years after <i>Breakfast of Champions</i>. This fact is proven by
the  subject matter  of <i>Hocus  Pocus</i>, which  he published in 1990
when he was  sixty-seven years old. The years  seem to have taken
their toll on the youthful and  zany sense of liberalism that was
prevalent in  his past novels,  as suggested by  Jay McInerney of
<i>The New York  Times</i>: "As if racing against  a clock, Mr. Vonnegut
is working  much closer to the  ground in <i>Hocus Pocus</i>,"  he says.
"Some readers  may miss the  wilder leaps of  imagination and the
whimsy"  (McInerney  12).   Vonnegut's  deviation  from  anti-war
idealism in the novel becomes strikingly apparent when he inserts
a commendation of West Point:

         Let  me  say  further  to  the  chance young reader that
         I would probably  have wrecked my  body and been  thrown
         out of the  University of Michigan and died  on Skid Row
         somewhere if I had not  been subjected to the discipline
         of West Point.I entered the  Point a young punk with bad
         posture  and a  sunken chest,  and no  history of sports
         participation, save for a  few fights after dances where
         our band  had played. When  I graduated and  received my
         commission as  a Second Lieutenant in  the Regular Army,
         and tossed my hat in the  air, and bought a red Corvette
         with the back  pay the Academy had put  aside for me, my
         spine  was as  straight as  a ramrod,  my lungs  were as
         capacious as the  bellows of the forge of  Vulcan, I was
         captain of the  judo and wrestling teams, and  I had not
         smoked  any sort  of cigarette  or swallowed  a drop  of
         alcohol  for  four  whole  years!  Nor  was  I  sexually
         promiscuous  anymore. I  never  felt  better in  my life
         (page 60).

This passage is a paradox  of an earlier assertion from <i>Breakfast
of Champions</i>,  when Vonnegut disdained West  Point as "a military
academy which turned young men  into homicidal maniacs for use in
war" (page 153). Clearly, <i>Hocus Pocus</i> serves as a perfect example
of the degeneration of his liberal views.

     Evidently,   Vonnegut's  anti-war   mentality  has   changed
dramatically  throughout  the  years  of  his  life.  Five of his
novels,  published over  a span  of thirty  years, illustrate the
transition perfectly.  <i>Mother Night</i> and <i>Cat's  Cradle</i> display the
progressive growth  of his visionary mentality  toward the nature
of  <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, which  illustrates his  idealism at  its
prime. <i>Breakfast of Champions</i> and <i>Hocus Pocus</i> subsequently depict
the visible  decline of his youth-minded  notions. Although these
works   collectively   portray   Vonnegut   as   an  author  with
a perpetually variant mentality, he will always remain one of the
most innovate novelists of the twentieth century.
