distant regions of the nervous system. The axon is the main conducting
unit of the neuron, capable of conveying electrical signals along distances
that range from as short as 0.1 mm to as long as 2 m. Many axon split into
several branches, thereby conveying information to different targets. Many
neurons do not have axons. In these so-called amacrine neurons, all the
neuronal processess are dendrites. Neurons with very short axons are also
found.&nbsp;</FONT> 
<P><FONT COLOR="#000080">The axons of many neurons are wrapped in a myelin
sheat, which is composed of the membranes of intersticial cells and is
wrapped around the axons to form several concentric layers. The myelin
sheath is broken at various points by the nodes of Ranvier, so that in
cross section it looks like a string of sausages. The myelin protects the
axon, and prevents interference between axons as they pass along in bundles,
sometimes thousands at time.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000080">The cells that wrap around peripheral nerve fibers
- that is, nerve fibers outside of the brain and spinal cord - are called
Schwann cells (because they were first described by Theodor Schwann). The
cells that wrap around axons within the central nervous system (brain and
spinal cord) are called oligodendrocytes. The axon, with its surrounded
sheath, is called a nerve fiber. Between each pair of sucessive Schwann
cells is a gap of a node of Ranvier.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>

junctions that neurons are excited, inhibited, or modulated. There are
two types of synapse, electrical and chemical.&nbsp;</FONT>

terminal is in electrical continuity with the postsynaptic. Ions and small
molecules passing through, thus connecting channels from one cell to the
next, so that electrical changes in one cell are transmitted almost instantaneously
to the next. Ions can generally flow both ways at these junctions i.e.
they tend to be bi-directional, although there are electrical junctions
where the ions can only flow one way, these are know as rectifying junctions.
Rectifying junctions are used to synchronise the firing of nerve cells.&nbsp;</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000080"><B>Chemical synaptic</B> junction is more complicated.
The gap between the post- and presynaptic terminals is larger, and the
mode of transmission is not electrical, but carried by neurotransmitters,
neuroactive substances released at the presynaptic side of the junction.
There are two types of chemical junctions. Type I is an excitatory synapse,
generally found on dendrites, type II is an inhibitory synapse, generally
found on cell bodies. Different substances are released at these two types
of synapse. The direction of flow of information is usually one way at
these junctions.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000080">Each terminal button is connected to other neurons
across a small gap called a synapse. The physical and neurochemical characteristics
of each synapse determines the strength and polarity of the new input signal.
This is where the brain is the most flexible, and the most vulnerable.
Changing the constitution of various neurotransmitter chemicals can increase
or decrease the amount of stimulation that the firing axon imparts on the
neighbouring dendrite. Altering the neurotransmitters can also change whether
the stimulation is excitatory or inhibitory.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
