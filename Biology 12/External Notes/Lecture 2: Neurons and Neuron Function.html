<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">Lecture 2: Neurons and Neurophysiology</P>

<B><P>Neurons: </B>Neurons are specialized so that they show irritability and conductivity.  There are between 10 and 50 billion nerve cells in the nervous system.</P>

<B><P>The Role of Neurons in the CNS:</P>

<UL>
</B><LI>Communication</LI>
<LI>Inhibition of other neurons</LI>
<LI>Integration of signals from a variety of possible sources (other neurons,  sensory stimulation)</LI>
<LI>Stores internal representations</LI>
<LI>Learning of experience-dependent representations (subserving a kind memory and memory retrieval)</LI>
<LI>Response to stimulation (external or from other neurons)</LI>
<LI>Some can be secretory cells (For example in the hypothalamus, which secretes hormones that act on the posterior pituitary.)</LI></UL>


<B><P>Types of Neurons:</P>
</B><P>Multiple ways to classify neurons</P>

<P>Based on neuronal function</P>

<UL>
<LI>Sensory neurons</LI>
<LI>Motor neurons</LI>
<LI>Interneurons</LI>
<LI>Projection Neurons</LI></UL>


<P>Based on shape</P>

<UL>
<LI>Anaxonal: </LI>
<LI>have no neurites at all</LI>
<LI>they are normally found in the sensory systems of the eye and ear</LI></UL>


<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
<LI>Monopolar: </LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>have a single neurite that is primarily an axon, but also may have a few dendritic  branches  near the axon hillock</LI>
<LI>often act as interneurons and motor neurons</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>Bipolar: </LI>
<LI>have two neurites, one axon and one dendrite</LI>
<LI>these cells are fairly rare</LI>
<LI>they are generally seen in sensory systems, particularly the eye</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>Multipolar:</LI>
<LI>Have a single long axon and many dendritic trees branching from the cell body</LI>
<LI>Found in many places in the CNS </LI>
<LI>There are multiple types of multipolar cells:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Pyramidal cells :</LI>
<LI>named for their shape</LI>
<LI>dendrites normally receive information from more lateral nerve cells and also cells that are in the same cell layer</LI>
<LI>axons project to other cortical regions, sub-cortical regions, and the spinal cord </LI>
<LI>axons are often mylinated</LI>
<LI>Stellate or Granule cells</LI>
<LI>Star shaped </LI>
<LI>Can act as an inhibitory cell in communication between the brain and sensory systems</LI></UL>
</UL>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Purkinje cells </LI>
<LI>Found in the cerebellum and interpositus nucleus</LI>
<LI>Seems to be the critical kind of interneuron during classical conditioning for learning and storing sensory and motor associations.</LI></UL>
</UL>


<B><P>Neuroglial</P>
</B><P>There are between 50 and 250 billion glia cells in the nervous system.  They share many characteristics with neurons.  For example they carry a membrane potential and they are sensitive to chemical changes in their  environment.  They are different in that they do not respond to stimulation by showing an action potential, they tend to have a smaller cell body, and their branching is much more symmetrical than the neurons.</P>

<B><P>The role of the glial cells:</P>

<UL>
</B><LI>Aid in communication process</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Provide insulation (myelination) that makes communication more efficient.</LI>
<LI>Modify the chemical surroundings of the neuron </LI></UL>

<LI>Remove dead neurons (very important for recovery after brain damage).</LI>
<LI>Aid in the development of the nervous system</LI>
<LI>Maintain the neurons </LI>

<UL>
<LI>Provide nutrients</LI>
<LI>Carry away waste</LI></UL>
</UL>


<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Types of Neuroglial:</P>

<P>Astrocytes</B> <B>or astroglia: </P>

<UL>
</B><LI>Aid in the structural support and development of the nervous system</LI>
<LI>Regulate extracellular levels of potassium</LI>
<LI>Proliferate in response to different kinds of infection and disorder, make-up much of tumor tissue</LI>
<LI>Help in form blood-brain barrier</LI>
<LI>They may also help regulate intercellular communication.  For example, they may physically cover or uncover synaptic regions.  This may lead to a change in synaptic communication or the development of new synaptic connections.  This involvement in synaptic communication may actually play a functional role during learning.</LI></UL>

<B>
<P>Oligodendrocytes</B>:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Generate myelin in CNS</LI>
<LI>Myelin acts as an electrical insulator and increases the speed of conduction of electrical impulses within the nerve&#146;s axon.</LI>
<LI>A single oligodendrocyte will form the myelin for many CNS nerve cells</LI></UL>

<B>
<P>Schwann cells</B>:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Generate myelin in PNS</LI>
<LI>A single Schwann cell wraps the axon of a single PNS nerve cell</LI></UL>

<B>
<P>Microglial:</P>

<UL>
</B><LI>Remove cellular debris after injury or other cell death</LI>
<LI>Can be mobile and might serve a defensive function</LI></UL>


<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Neuron degeneration and regeneration</P>

<UL>
</B><LI>Up to one quarter of our neurons die by age 80-90.</LI>
<LI>In the PNS: if the axon is severed the cell will normally survive and an axon is regenerated.</LI>
<LI>In the CNS: if the axon is severed generally the whole cell will die.</LI></UL>

<B>
<P>Neuronal Structure:</P>
</B><P>Neurons contain the cell body and most contain at least one neurite.  A neurite refers to a projection that comes from the cell body.  There are two types of neurites axons, which generally carry information away from the cell body, and  dendrites that carry information to the cell body.</P>

<B><P>Cell body or Soma</B>:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Metabolic center, keeps the neuron alive and functioning</LI>
<LI>Produce most neurotransmitters (the substances which allow for communication across the synapse).</LI>
<LI>Also can be a receptive site for the axons of other cells</LI></UL>


<B><P>Neurites:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Dendrites</B>:  </LI>
<LI>Primary receptive area of the neuron</LI>
<LI>May have dendritic spines, which are projections that increase the number of receptive sites.</LI>
<LI>The biggest difference between different kinds of neurons is due to differences in the dendrites.</LI>
<LI>Highly studied in areas of individual differences, learning, &amp; effects of environment on animal intelligence.</LI>
<LI>Generally communicate via afferent impulses (toward the cell body).</LI></UL>



<UL>
<B><LI>Axons</B>:</LI>
<LI>Most often one per neuron</LI>
<LI>Contain microtubules: kind of subway for neurotransmitters.</LI>
<LI>Important parts of the axon:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Initial segment: right next to the cell body, this is the part which is the starting point the action potentials generated in a neuron.  </LI>
<LI>Myelinated portion of the axon.  </LI>
<LI>Can vary a lot in length. </LI>
<LI>Contain the Nodes of Ranvier:  gaps in the myelin which allow for the movement of electrical impulse (action potential) along the axon.</LI>
<LI>Axon terminals:  these are the ends of the axon, the area which releases neurotransmitters into the synapse.</LI>
<LI>Two kinds of transport of information through the axon:</LI>
<LI>Anterograde:  from the cell body to the terminal; neurotransmitters move via anterograde transport.</LI>
<LI>Retrograde:  from the terminal to the cell body</LI></UL>
</UL>

<B>
<P>Cell Membrane</P>
</B><P>Surrounding all these structures is the cell membrane</P>

<UL>
<LI>The cell membrane is made up of a phospholipid compound.</LI>
<LI>It is arranged so that there are two layers of water and fatty acid molecule combinations.  This structure is referred to as the lipid bilayer.</LI>
<LI>The membrane is normally about 4 nm thick.</LI>
<LI>This membrane also contains a number of different types of proteins.</LI>
<LI>The proteins contained in the membrane layers helps to determine the neurons individual function.</LI></UL>



<UL>
<LI>Three important types of proteins include:</LI>
<LI>Transport proteins: which regulate the flow of ions through the membrane</LI>
<LI>Signaling proteins: which allow the neuron to respond to signaling molecules emitted by other neurons</LI>
<LI>Binding proteins: which help anchor the neurons to other cells </LI></UL>


<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Intracellular space</B>: between the glial and neurons is a fluid filled space. </P>

<UL>
<LI>Makes up about 20% of the mass of the brain</LI>
<LI>Important because the make up of this liquid is very sensitive.  Precise levels of sodium and potassium must be maintained.</LI>
<LI>Fluid and cells are protected by the <B>blood-brain barrier.</LI></UL>

</B>
<B><P>Synapse</P>
</B><P>Most chemical synapses span about 20-30 nm in space.  This space is called the synaptic cleft.  </P>

<UL>
<LI>Synapses are polarized, thus information can only move in a single direction.</LI>
<LI>However, there are situations called reciprocal synapses which refer to an area in which there are two synapses close together  that are transmitting information in  the opposite direction.  </LI>
<LI>In addition to the common condition in which the axon synapses onto a postsynaptic dendrite.  Nerve cells can form synapses between just about any combination of areas.</LI></UL>
