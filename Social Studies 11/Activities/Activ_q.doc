\par Nuclear Energy Arguments}
\par 
\par \pard {\fs20 
Since the nuclear era began in the 1940s, people have had high hopes for atomic power.  It seemed to promise great amounts of clean energy from a practically inexhaustible source at very low cost.  Nuclear power produces about 100 million times as much en
ergy per atom as most fossil fuels, without contributing to problems such as smog and acid rain.
\par 
\par However, people have a great fear of the potential for catastrophic accidents at nuclear reactor facilities.  Accidents at Three Mile Island in the United States and at the Chernobyl reactor in the Ukraine, have shaken the public\rquote 
s confidence in the safet
y of this energy source.  Critics feel that the risks involved far outweigh the benefits.  Estimates of the number of deaths that resulted from the explosion of the reactor at Chernobyl range from 30 to 300.  Officials in the Ukraine state that at least 4
00,000 people were exposed to high radiation levels.  And because the ground surrounding the site was contaminated, local water and produce were not able to be consumed by residents.  Children are dying of radiation-induced leukemia.
\par 
\par Although there have been problems, nuclear advocates point to new reactors which are far less prone to overheating and require less constant care.  They believe that the new reactors could be tested and placed into service by the new millennium.  However,
 critics say that it will take many years to test these new reactors and put them into service.  Critics also state that we should work toward conservation measures and alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind power.
\par 
\par In addition, the safe disposal of the waste products of this technology causes concern to the public. However, it is felt by many proponents of the use of nuclear power that this fear may be due to the scarcity of accurate information about this source of
 energy.  There seems to be a lack of public participation or knowledge about the issue. 
\par  
\par The production of nuclear energy produces radioactive waste products which must be disposed of.  Currently, they are stored at the sites of the reactors that produce them\emdash 
a temporary solution. They must be placed in metal or ceramic containers so that the radioactivity cannot contaminate the surroundings, and located far away from any population centre.
\par 
\par Advocates note that the amount of waste produced by North American nuclear energy plants is fairly small.  Some feel that the amount of waste is negligible compared to the waste produced by burning fossil fuels.
\par 
\par The cost of nuclear energy has been gradually rising the last several years due in part, according to advocates, to excessive safety regulations which have been put in place, to delays caused by licensing requirements, and to the price of waste disposal. 
 However, both France and Japan rely heavily on nuclear power and both countries, according to industry spokespeople, have made it simpler for new plants to be 
licensed.  In these two countries, the cost of nuclear power is lower than that from other sources.
\par 
\par }\pard \qc {\b \page }{\b\fs28\ul Anti-nuclear Arguments}
\par John McCarthy 
\par {\fs20 
\par }\pard {\fs20 Here are some arguments and some answers.
\par 
\par }{\b\fs20 The waste problem hasn't been solved.}{\fs20  
\par 
\par The fuel for a nuclear power plant consists of hollow rods containing pellets of fissionable material - uranium oxide enriched in U-235 for the most common reactor type - the light water reactor. After 18 months to two years in the reactor, there is too l
ittle fissionable material to allow the reactor to continue to run at full power. The fuel rods are then removed and replaced by new rods. This takes about a month.
\par 
\par When removed from the reactor, the fuel rods are extremely radioactive and are continuing to generate heat. In fact, about 1/2 percent of the total energy is generated after the fuel rods are removed. At present it isn't considered worthwhile to try to ma
ke use of this heat, and the rods are stored under water. The water can absorb and dissipate the heat, but the rods remain intact and continue to confine the radioactive material.
\par 
\par After five or more years in "swimming pool" storage, the fuel rods can be moved for reprocessing or for long term storage. There is no harm in leaving them in the pools for much longer times, but then enough storage has to be provided. What to do next is 
causing a lot of dithering in the US and some countries---but not in all countries.
\par 
\par The normal solution is to move the rods to a reprocessing plant. There they are dissolved in suitable acids and the
 constituents separated. There is some leftover uranium which is depleted in U-235, at least relative to fresh fuel. It could be put into an enrichment plant again, but apparently this isn't done. There is plutonium, which is suitable for use as reactor f
uel. This is the best thing to do with it. The plutonium from a power reactor contains a substantial fraction of Pu-240 which fissions spontaneously. For this reason, plutonium from the spent fuel is not used in nuclear explosives.
\par 
\par The major constituent of
 the spent fuel consists of fission products. These are elements of middling atomic mass and many of them are still very radioactive and will remain radioactive for hundreds or thousands of years. The elements that are most radioactive decay the fastest, 
so the amount of radioactivity is constantly reduced. Still it takes about 500 years for the overall level of radioactivity to be less than that of the original uranium ore.
\par 
\par The 500 years is mainly a talking point. No one would want to live in a uranium mine, but at least it enables one to distinguish reasonable concern from unreasonable panic.
\par 
\par After the fuel is reprocessed, it is important to keep the fission products from contact with people. The French solution is to make a glass out of the products and store the waste in caverns cut in granite. This will surely work. There is one cubic meter
 of waste produced in a year by a 1,000 megawatt reactor, so the caverns don't have to be dug very fast.
\par 
\par The proposed American solution was similar, and the favored place to store the waste is the Nevada Test Site which has already a lot of fission products from bomb tests.  However, this solution has been stalled temporarily by environmentalist politics in 
successive administrations and by objections from the state of Nevada.
\par 
\par In the meantime American waste remains in the "swimming pools". There is no harm in this, and the fact that there is no physical harm in delay encourages more and
 more delay. There is the political and psychological harm that delaying an important decision is used as an argument against nuclear energy.\page 
Actually the American situation is complicated by the Carter Administration decision to refrain from reprocessing
 and dispose of the plutonium along with the fission products. This decision is wasteful and gives rise to arguments about proliferation, because someone might get the plutonium. The theory behind Carter's decision was that it would influence other govern
ments to refrain from extracting plutonium from their wastes. No other government has been influenced, but reprocessing has not been resumed.
\par 
\par }{\b Nuclear energy is uneconomical compared to other sources}. 
\par {\fs20 
I don't really have to answer this for the primary objective of showing the sustainability of progress, because I need only show that it is economical enough to sustain progress. It seems to me that the French, Japanese and American experience shows this.
 As to its relative economy, many countries are expanding and initiating programs of nuclear energy. China and Indonesia are recent examples.
\par However, when there is plenty of natural gas, that is likely to be cheaper while it lasts. In some places, coal may be cheaper, but this depends on how you count the environmental costs of coal.}
\par 
\par {\b It is bad for humanity to have plenty of energy}. 
\par {\fs20 Both Paul Ehrlich and Emory Lovins used to say that, but I think they have soft pedaled the point recently.  Actually, Ehrlich continues the point to some degree in his 1995 book  }{\i\fs20 The Stork and the Plow.}
\par 
\par {\b Nuclear reactors produce plutonium, and plutonium is terrible because it can be used to make bombs. }
\par {\fs20 
Perhaps I have caricatured this argument, but I haven't seen it in a coherent form. Safeguards are indeed needed. There is no policy including a ban on nuclear energy that can prevent a determined country from launching a nuclear war. So far deterrents ha
ve sufficed, and a total ban would give an enormous advantage to the first country to violate it.
\par }
\par {\b Plutonium is the most toxic substance in existence}. 
\par {\fs20 It isn't the most toxic substance. There are plenty of toxic substances, and they occasionally poison people. Plutonium is one of the easiest to keep under control.}
\par 
\par {\b Plutonium symbolizes nuclear war}. 
\par {\fs20 Purely symbolic arguments have no force.}
\par 
\par {\b Nuclear reactors are likely to have accidents with severe consequences for humanity. 
\par }{\fs20 Chernobyl was the worst. There are now many hundreds of reactor years of experience, and Chernobyl was the only accident that injured the public. That's a good record for a source of energy}.
\par 
\par {\b Radiation from operating nuclear reactors, uranium mining and other nuclear activities harm humanity}. 
\par {\fs20 
\par There is now enough experience so that the harm is extremely small compared to other human activities and especially compared to other sources of energy. It is also far below the harm from natural sources of radioactivity}.
\par 
\par {\fs20 In the end, people must decide for themselves by analyzing the pro\rquote s and cons of each energy source.
\par }\pard \qc {\b \page }{\b\fs32 Solar Energy}{\b  }
\par 
\par \pard {\fs20 It has been said that no matter how much we realize we must conserve our resources, other sources of energy will still be needed in the future.
\par 
\par As a renewable source, solar energy is plentiful, environmentally safe and naturally replenished.  Through the use of photovoltaic cells, solar radiation is converted directly into electricity.  And whether it is the use of a few cells to generate enough 
power to perform a small task or to heat a house, or a large solar thermal \ldblquote farm\rdblquote  to power generators, solar energy is the most popular and widely-used source of renewable energy.
\par 
\par Although it is acknowledged that the sun produces less energy on cloudy days and short winter days, and none at night, advocates believe that technology has advanced to a place where methods of storing energy have proven efficient and cost effective.  In 
addition, the industry provides more jobs than do conventional energy sources: skilled tradesmen are needed for design, manufacture, installation, maintenance, research and development.
\par 
\par Solar energy is more flexible as to whe
re it can be harnessed.  Unlike fossil fuels, which must be extracted from the earth and transported long distances, solar energy cells can be mounted within a few feet of whatever they are powering; for example, in areas which are a great distance from c
onventional power grids and where there is low population.  Solar energy gathering stations can be installed in areas of high unemployment.
\par 
\par The major deterrent for people is the large initial outlay of money required to install solar panels and storage fac
ilities.  A solution would be the provision of low-interest loans for purchasing this technology.  Also, grants and subsidies could be provided to low-income families, and costs could be written off as tax credits.
\par 
\par Public utilities and power companies see solar as a competitor.  As a result, their rate structure is a barrier to solar cell owners and people who are trying to conserve energy: the more you use, the cheaper it gets.
\par 
\par At present, there is no guarantee to individual property owners that sunlight won\rquote t be blocked by trees, high-rise buildings or billboards on adjoining properties.  Governments could encourage solar zones and give people \ldblquote sun rights.
\rdblquote 
\par 
\par With the support of government, creation of a strong domestic solar energy industry would provide more encouraging results than in the past.  Governments could ensure that installation did not result in an increase of property tax assessments. Municipal, 
provincial and federal governments could create incentives for developers and builders to use this technology.
\par 
\par An innovative piece of solar technology is being tested in the United States by several groups, including the U.S. Department of Energy.  The \ldblquote Solar Two\rdblquote 
 power plant is comprised of 2,000 giant computer-aimed mirrors which reflect the sun\rquote s rays onto pipe
s full of molten salt.  This hot salt can retain a large percentage of its heat for 12 hours after sundown, then produces steam to drive turbines, generating electricity for 10,000 homes.   The \ldblquote Solar Two\rdblquote 
 is a prototype for an even larger commercial plant which is expected to be built in the near future.
\par 
\par However, power from \ldblquote Solar Two\rdblquote 
 costs from 10 to 14 cents per kilowatt-hour, while fossil fuel plants generate energy for 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour.  A wider field of mirrors would have to be constructed in order to be able to generate enough energy 
to be viable, and such an endeavor would cost too much to make it competitive.
\par 
\par Many people do not realize the need for change to different sources and they are reluctant to change.  Seemingly, many people need a crisis or emergency before moving.
\par }\pard \qc {\fs20 \page }{\b\fs32 WIND TURBINES}{\fs20 
\par 
\par }\pard {\fs20 
The use of wind as an energy source dates back 2,000 years to the first known windmills in Persia.  Until the invention of the steam engine, wind ranked second only to wood as an energy source.  The land reclaimed by the people of the Netherlands from the
 North Sea was the result of the use of windmills to drain marshes and lakes to create arable land.  At the 
time of European settlement in North America, small windmills were commonly used on farms for pumping water for animal and human use, for grinding grain and for running sawmills.  Later, wind-driven electrical generators were able to produce modest amount
s of power to operate radios.
\par 
\par The general use of windmills declined with the invention of the steam engine, which was fueled by coal.  And as electrical grids spread throughout the countryside, and cheap energy was made readily available, windmills were no longer as popular.
\par 
\par At the end of the last century, several countries attempted to use large windmills to supply electrical energy to communities.  Denmark was the first to experiment, followed by England, France, Russia, Germany and the United States.  However, these experi
ments proved too costly to be feasible at that time.
\par 
\par Several years ago, when the western countries experienced a fuel shortage, many governments encouraged the development of new methods of capturing wind power for domestic and commerc
ial use.  Later, when oil prices lowered, there was not the same drive to create this technology.  With the concern raised over pollution by the use of non-renewable energy sources, and considering the fact that these resources will eventually be depleted
, environmental groups and other concerned organizations have pressed governments to again encourage the development of large experimental wind turbines.
\par 
\par Wind energy is clean: there are no pollutants.  It may be used indefinitely.  Those of us who live in 
Canada know that there are many locations where it is windy.  Yet, experts know that the windiest areas are usually in the less-populated regions of any country\emdash 
in Canada, along the exposed coasts of the East, the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Labrador; in the North, around Hudson\rquote 
s Bay; and in the southwestern prairies.  In these areas a windmill mounted on a 30 meter high tower would intercept lots of raw power.  These windy areas tend to be far from the population centres where most people live and where most
 energy is used.  The wind is an intermittent, randomly fluctuating and inconveniently distributed source of energy, making the design of wind-powered machines a challenge.
\par 
\par In order to set up wind turbines, the local site must be looked at critically because of the dramatic effects of small changes in wind speed.  Wind speeds are greatest over long stretches of flat terrain that are free from obstructions, or over mountain c
rests or rounded hilltops.  Trees and man-made structures, such as buildings, can significantly reduce wind speeds and cause turbulence which could damage turbines.
\par 
\par A windmill is typically a horizontal axis, multi-blade wind machine\emdash 
such as the farm windmill used for pumping water.  It is self-starting; that is, when the wind blows, the blades turn.  The farm windmill had a rudder which pointed into the wind, so that
 the blades were always facing the direction of the wind.  The horizontal turbines used in the \ldblquote wind farms\rdblquote  near Palm Springs, in southern California\emdash an area covered with hundreds of evenly-spaced wind generators\emdash 
all face the same direction of the prevailing winds and cannot accept wind from any other direction.
\par 
\par Vertical axis wind generators are more unusual looking.  They have two or three thin, curved blades which are perpendicular to the ground and in an eggbeater shape.  The advantages to this type of generator are that it can be located near the ground, it c
an accept wind from any direction and the axis of the wind machine forms part of the tower.  However, they are not s
elf-starting.  An auxiliary power system to start rotation is required.  And they are not generally available in small sizes, but may be a promising technology for the future.\page 
The most efficient wind speed for generating electricity is 30 to 40 kilometers
 per hour.  Unfortunately, wind speed is not the same all the time, so electricity may not be available when needed.  At other times, more electricity may be produced than is needed.  In addition, the wind energy conversion systems can convert approximate
ly 45 percent of the available wind power into electricity.
\par 
\par Because of the danger of destructive turbulence in an urban situation, it is not possible for homeowners to use wind turbines as they might utilize solar panels.  Therefore, only large-scale operations will be the way of the future for heavily-populated a
reas.  However, it is possible for small-scale applications to be economically attractive for performing on-site tasks, particularly in the agriculture sector.  In Canada, turbines are subject to forces of nature\emdash 
ice, salt spray, dust, the stresses of turbulence.
\par 
\par  In order to win broad utility acceptance by the public, costs of wind-generated electricity from large wind farms must decrease significantly.  The future of this technology depends on several factors, most notably the cost and availability of convention
al fuels.  Wind is a valuable resource because it can be combined with other renewable resources, such as solar, or can generate supplemental electricity for a utility that ordinarily depends on conventional fuels.  
\par 
\par The most economical way of utilizing wind-powered energy, avoiding storage, is by feeding power directly into the transmission network.  When winds are not blowing, power is provided by a conventional source, such as an oil-powered generating station
\emdash a mixed-fuel saving system.}
\par {\fs20 
\par }\pard \qc {\fs20 \page }{\b\fs32 HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS}{\fs22 
\par 
\par }\pard {\fs22 Fuel cells are an efficient, non-polluting power source which produces no noise and has no moving parts.  Such cells have been providing electricity on spacecraft since the 1960s.  C
ommon applications could be to power automobiles and buses, leaving no exhaust to pollute the air, and in generating stations.
\par 
\par The cells run on hydrogen which reacts with oxygen from the air in such a way that a voltage is generated between two electrodes.  Some designs consume hydrogen directly; others start with natural gas that is converted to hydrogen before entering the cell
.  Compared with conventional fossil-fuel power sources, fuel cells are exceptionally clean and efficient.  Practically their onl
y waste product is water.  Natural gas-fueled cells do produce some carbon dioxide as well, though less than would be created if the fuel were burned.
\par 
\par In the United States, some hospitals and remote hotels are using fuel cell units to ensure a reliable source of energy.  Each cell provides 200 kilowatts of power; the heat each produces can also be used to warm buildings.  The units, which use phosphoric
 acid as an electrolyte, are designed to last 20 years.
\par 
\par However, these phosphoric acid units are heavy, 
especially for vehicles.  Other companies are developing light-weight cells that are specifically designed for vehicles.  One company, Ballard Power Systems from Vancouver, has developed a fuel cell which is light-weight.  It\rquote s called the 
\ldblquote proton-exchange membrane\rdblquote  (PEM), and instead of using phosphoric acid, it utilizes a thin polymer membrane as its electrolyte.
\par 
\par Other companies, namely Toyota and Daimler-Benz, have also experimented with cell-powered automobiles.  Daimler-Benz unveiled the world\rquote s first consumer-friendly fuel cell car, the \ldblquote NECAR II\rdblquote  minivan in 1996.
\par 
\par Studies by BMW engineers indicate that liquid hydrogen could be used as a power source because of the extensive 625 mile range it offers.  This application uses designs which were originally used in submarines.  A liquid hydrogen fuel tank would be placed
 in the car\rquote s back seat area, and a fuel cell stack and air compressor would replace the internal combustion engine under the vehicle\rquote s hood.
\par 
\par The main drawback with powering automobiles with fuel cells is providing the hydrogen.  Pressurized hydrogen tanks could put drivers at risk if the tanks are damaged in an accident.  The demonstration car by Toyota stored the hydrogen in compounds which a
re safe but heavy and cumbersome.  Toyota and Daimler-Benz have also experimented with obtaining hydrogen from methanol which is easier to transport and pump into a car.
\par 
\par In the spring of 1997, Daimler-Benz and Ballard Power Systems announced plans for jointly spending more than $450 million Canadian for the development, eventual series production and marketing of fuel cell power plants.
\par 
\par Two other types of fuel cell technologies use molten carbonate and solid oxide, which are far more efficient for stationary applications such as generating stations.  These applications run at far higher temperatures than PEM or phosphoric acid cells, and
 proponents say that it is possible to \page achieve 55 percent or more efficiency.  The hot steam and carbon dioxide which is 
produced can be used to drive a gas turbine which generates additional electricity, which could raise the efficiency to a possible 80 percent.  Scientists believe they are up to twice as efficient as a typical oil- or coal-fired plant.
\par 
\par The positive side of the fuel cell is that emission consists of water, that there is no noise factor, and the electro-chemical process inside it is 20 to 30 percent more efficient compared to the thermodynamic process of today\rquote 
s gasoline and diesel engines.
\par 
\par Critics of the m
olten carbonate technology point out that such cells use highly corrosive molten salts as electrolytes, and these salts create problems in design and maintenance.  Several companies in North America and Europe are attempting to create solutions to this pr
oblem using solid oxide fuel cells in different configurations.
\par 
\par Fuel cells face tough competition in a world with cheap oil, but may be an application in the near future for people in those parts of the world where electricity is expensive or must travel great distances.
